1ju0ava,csbagley,I find it amazing that there are several institutions applying for Dogecoin ETF‚Äôs but some lowly traders keep spreading FUD and trying to convince newer traders NOT TO invest in a great project like Doge! Doge is considered a currency type coin that is fast in transaction speed and cheap! Several big name companies and sports teams take doge as payment! I guess some traders like to think they can influence others to invest in their project thinking its going to cause it to spike and they can sell for profits but they are fools! Yes let them see when the dust settles that Doge will always be the king meme coin! All they did was miss the boat!,2,1744326050.0,2025-04-10 23:00:50

1jzcnj2,Fulvio55,"Price and value are completely different things.  Say you find a coin in your change that is special. Maybe an error. Maybe a rare date. Whatever.  Its value is what it says on it. But its price could be thousands, even millions, if you found someone prepared to pay.  Doge is the same. Its value is what you can do with it. Its price is what someone agrees to pay for it.  Oh, and marketcap, while handy for comparing cryptos, is meaningless. It‚Äôs just the price multiplied by the total number of coins ever mined. There is absolutely no consideration of coins lost, burnt or otherwise no longer available.",2,1744675174.0,2025-04-14 23:59:34
1jzcnj2,liquid_at,"""value"" can be many things at the same time. A coin might have the nominal value assured by the government that issued it, but that government can also be gone. The material in itself, especially when it is silver or gold, does have material value. If the coin is specifically well produced there might even be artistic or collector value. If it came from an interesting time in history, that also might be value.  ""price"" is what anyone is willing to pay.   If you take your coin to the bank, they will give you the nominal value and that will be the price.  If you take it to a museum, they might value it high, but won't pay you, so the price is nil.   And if you find a crazy collector, your price might be significantly higher than the sum of all values.",1,1744707410.0,2025-04-15 08:56:50

For example, I once met a guy who was scooping up old women‚Äôs magazines for free or a few cents each, then cutting them up and selling individual full page ad pages for $5 each. He couldn‚Äôt keep up with demand.  When it comes to crypto, and especially Doge, there‚Äôs the price which determines your ability to trade or spend, and the intangible of the value of holding and participating here for example.  In my mind, the value here far exceeds any money my coins might be worth. What value do trading skills you can learn cheaply have?

1k44dnm,Alternative_Demand96,Why would you use a website to generate a wallet,14,1745208154.0,2025-04-21 04:02:34
1k44dnm,Saint-Kevin,"I was testing it out.  It was years ago when doge wasn't worth much.  I just forgot about it until earlier this year, didn't bother taking it out.  Just thought there are some others that might have done the same but with larger amounts and am trying to warn others.",6,1745208345.0,2025-04-21 04:05:45
1k44dnm,Fulvio55,"Yes, walletgenerator has been compromised twice that we know of.  In one instance there was a clone site that phoned home with all the wallets it generated. We mounted a concerted effort to flood it with millions of wallets until it was taken down, which took a few days.  In the other case there was a bug where it was reusing the same wallets repeatedly. That one was fixed fairly quickly as well.  This is an open source project, and anyone could download the code and run it in preference to using the live site.  I generally advise people to generate thousands of bulk wallets and to let them stew for as long as possible before using any of them randomly. For immediate needs, coinb.in will generate single wallets which you can do offline on your own copy, not the live site.  I think you may have fallen victim to one of the two instances above. I think a blanket warning isn‚Äôt warranted though. All wallets are identical, and how you generate them is irrelevant. The risk is not in the methodology but in someone else having access to the keys either through compromised code, in transit, or through malware on your devices.  I‚Äôm sorry for your loss. Did you have other wallets from the same time as well? And were they bulk or a single wallet?",13,1745210095.0,2025-04-21 04:34:55

I don‚Äôt understand the crypto thing. It seems more like a collectible. Something people buy because they‚Äôre not confident enough to invest in the stock market, it‚Äôs cheap and it‚Äôs something to stare at. I‚Äôve asked friends and it‚Äôs always some half baked elusive response in an attempt to justify their hopes of a moon shot. Personally, I make more in one month of options premiums than any of my friends have made in crypto trading over the past 4 years. It just makes no sense to me.

1k0l28y,liquid_at,"Dogecoin can no longer be mined with GPUs. Scrypt is such a specialized and demanding algorithm, that only ASICs (= special hardware designed to do one function only) are the only reasonable way to mine dogecoin.  If you want to utilize your GPU for something related to crypto, there are some mining sites that choose which coin to mine for you, while you choose which coin you want to be paid with.   And I'd definitely recommend to read up on crypto, because it is not untraceable. It is the opposite, very traceable. (if it is not a privacy coin). You just cannot determine the ownership of the wallets.  So if you move coins from Wallet A to Wallet B, no one can tell who the owners of Wallet A and Wallet B are. Could be you moving coins from one of your wallets to another of yours, or could be someone paying a 3rd party. No one knows who the owners are if the owners do not identify themselves.",4,1744827467.0,2025-04-16 18:17:47

All you have to do is pick the one that seems most trustworthy and avoid taking the one that promises you the biggest gains, especially if they promise you multiples of the trustworthy ones.  Scammers usually try to apeal to your greed. Crypto Investors protect themselves by doing their own research.   It's a new asset class.

1jzhhen,liquid_at,"Imho, if you wanted to drive wallets to the next level, any wallet-manager that allowed you to have a main account that manages the rights for different wallets and who gets to have access.  That way you could combine cold wallets with hot wallets and give users a ""money manager"" that allows them to choose what part of their coins they want to keep live and what they want to store.   But you should leave the idea of ""one wallet"" behind. If you have 100% of your coins in one wallet, all it takes is one wallet to be compromised for you to lose 100% of your property.   It's a human instinct to keep things tidy in one spot, but when it comes to security, that's a terrible idea.",3,1744708426.0,2025-04-15 09:13:46
1jzhhen,Tyguy047,That‚Äôs a really good idea. I could potentially find a way for the user to have one receive wallet and then that will distribute funds to a bunch of smaller wallets and when you send funds it pulls from all the sub wallets.,1,1744738573.0,2025-04-15 17:36:13
1jzhhen,liquid_at,"that's definitely an option. You just need to consider safety.   If your main wallet has all the private keys from all your other wallets, hacking that one wallet will give the attacker access to all wallets.   I'd compartmentalize it to a degree where it can be used freely by the owner, but any access point being compromised (except for the root one) would still not mean that all funds can be drained.   But of course, you could set up a system that keeps your spending-wallet topped with a certain amount every 24h. This would ensure that you have always spending money around, but prevent anyone from stealing more than this amount within 24h if they happen to get access.   I think those types of systems that help owners of crypto to stay in control but make it harder for attackers to take over are definitely needed.",1,1744739505.0,2025-04-15 17:51:45

1jzhhen,Fulvio55,"Absolutely not so.  A text file stored offline is the MOST secure, provided two things. That you have copies and that they‚Äôre all stored in secure locations.

1jzhhen,Tyguy047,"Imagine you get a virus on your computer. The second you plug that external drive into your wallet, you're done! You should store them as an encrypted file type, whether it be PGP locking the file or encrypting the whole drive (or both!). Or store them on your computer and use a wallet software that encrypts the wallet's file when you generate the wallet. After that, you can store it offline, but still a good idea to encrypt it.  Also, the MOST secure way to store coin is with a Trezor, Ledger, or another hardware wallet since they have other security measures that most external drives don't.",1,1745236518.0,2025-04-21 11:55:18

Encryption has only ever served to separate people from their coins. Because humans suck at passwords. Just do a quick search and you‚Äôll find thousands of sob stories. And not a single one where such measures kept bad guys out.  Besides‚Ä¶ show me a virus that hunts for random file names on devices which are almost never connected. Or which search for doge keys.  And if you‚Äôre truly paranoid, it‚Äôs not hard to ‚Äòmassage‚Äô your keys, say by segmenting them and inserting garbage characters in the gaps.  I actually ran several competitions here, one with a million doge prize, challenging people to crack keys. They knew exactly what they were looking for, and it still took an inordinate effort. Effort which no one is going to put into hunting for wallets which may or may not contain anything, let alone worthwhile sums.  And no, a single piece of expensive hardware which can easily be lost, stolen or destroyed is NOT more secure at all. Just ask the several people who sent thousands of bitcoins to the dump on such devices.",1,1745257215.0,2025-04-21 17:40:15

1jzhhen,Fulvio55,"I did indeed.  I‚Äôve been doing this stuff since 1974. Macs since 1992. Never seen a virus, never met anyone who had either.  PCs on the other hand‚Ä¶ I stopped counting at a quarter of a million.  And encryption is pointless if you‚Äôre the only one with access. Or do you really think burglars are going to break into your house and search for a USB stick hidden someplace so they can steal your ten bucks worth of doge?  Never happened. Never will. Don‚Äôt believe me, try searching. OTOH, thousands have lost access to their wallets because they foolishly encrypted.  Oh, and for the record, the only place where it might make some sense would be a hot client like Core. Which I absolutely advise against as a way to store your coins. And even there, the biggest loss I‚Äôve come across was a guy physically sitting at the keyboard. Hardly a common circumstance, eh?",1,1745296558.0,2025-04-22 04:35:58

And we really don‚Äôt need yet more clients pretending to be wallets and relying totally on one person to maintain support to prevent everyone using them from losing their coins.  The past decade is littered with failed clients and people losing their coins as a result. It‚Äôs heartbreaking and it must stop.  Any wallet you cannot read with your very own eyeballs is going to cost you sooner or later. And pretty much all clients prevent or make it difficult to see your keys.  So if you want a project, abandon this idea. Instead, get involved with the coinb.in project and make it better than it already is. It isn‚Äôt a client and doesn‚Äôt take custody of your wallets, but many people are unable or unwilling to learn how transactions are built, so they see it as a hurdle in its current form.  By all means, fork it, make it doge specific and more intuitive. Then I‚Äôll happily preach about it like I have been about coinb.in.",1,1744769349.0,2025-04-16 02:09:09

There are times that bitcoin and m2 money supply are more correlated and times that they are not.  Market is complex and there is not a correct take on it.   As one of my experienced frader friends once told me, there are times that we have to focus on what we have right now and not what will happen next.    My opinion on the market is that tariffs are widely priced in, risk assets are currently pricing in the unclarity  around tuesdey/wednesday announcements. There is unclarity and there is fear. Also believe there are more people interestied in chasing longs then shorts from here, many were preserving wealth and chose not to participate.  one way to find out  Do only good everyday",1,1743472550.0,2025-04-01 01:55:50

At some point as a man you have to smarten up and stop making decisions with your feelings involved.

1jn94xb,jeremiahcp,"Dogecoin tends to follow Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements, but it‚Äôs unlikely to experience the same long-term growth. Despite the widespread ‚Äúto-the-moon‚Äù enthusiasm, Dogecoin was originally designed as a currency for everyday transactions, not a long-term investment asset. Its inflationary supply model means that new coins are continuously added to circulation, preventing it from serving as a reliable store of value.  Bitcoin, by contrast, has a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins, making it inherently deflationary over time. This scarcity, along with growing institutional adoption, has solidified Bitcoin‚Äôs reputation as a store of value or ‚Äúdigital gold.‚Äù Historically, Bitcoin has outperformed most other asset classes over the long term.  If you‚Äôre investing with a long-term perspective, it‚Äôs generally wiser to allocate more to Bitcoin and less to Dogecoin.

1jn94xb,TimeTravellingCircus,"Your principle investment would only reach 51k after 3 years, but not a lump sum, rather with a contribution time frame.  At a 15% rate of return each year, at the end of the 3rd year, you'd roughly hit a 100k portfolio at the end of your 3 year contribution time frame.  Considering that were expecting a crypto summer and winter both within the next 3 years.  You might balance those events to the equivalent of a 15-25% smoothed out growth rate over those 3 contribution years.  Then there's 7 more years of holding, which could also contain another crypto summer and winter.  I'd again rather factor a steady growth as the sum effect of those events, rate rather than account for windfalls and perfect timing.  Again just using a smooth 15% rate of return would put you at a quarter million at the end of 10 years.  No you won't be a millionaire.  Buying meme coins requires you to have had a sizeable holding before any specific market events occur and your daily contribution strategy doesn't really give you that leverage.  You'd likely experience the first crypto summer sometime soon from now, with very little held in those assets.  You'd be then ""betting"" on another crypto summer shortly after you reach maximum contribution at the end of 3 years.",2,1743352272.0,2025-03-30 16:31:12

1jn98ns,Issastake,Correct brother,6,1743332174.0,2025-03-30 10:56:14
1jn98ns,liquid_at,"By definition it is just a strategy that tries to average your buy-price to remove volatility.  This will lead to you buying at roughly the 50% level and is a safe strategy, not a profit-oriented one.  DCA can easily be optimized by changing fixed times of purchase to time-slots in which you try to get a temporary low to buy, as well as taking profits on runs that happen after a dip-buy.   DCA is just the easiest and safest method to use for beginners that do not understand crypto and do not have the ability to predict prices. It's not ""the only viable strategy"" though. Just the one a beginner with no understanding of anything is most likely to be able to work.   It's not a bad strategy, but if you tell yourself some fantastic stories about it being the only option there is, you are limiting yourself.",1,1743332570.0,2025-03-30 11:02:50

1jn98ns,liquid_at,"If you have no other methods, that's what makes you a beginner, yes. It is significantly better than luck. But it doesn't mean that better, yet more complex and riskier solutions exist. You just have to know and understand them fully, before they become a better alternative.  But never fool yourself by thinking things don't exist simply because you don't know about them. The world is bigger than your head.",1,1743338323.0,2025-03-30 12:38:43
1jn98ns,solenico,There‚Äôs is other methods of course. But if we have fully functional market as per studies in the long run DCA results overdrive everything else.   The few cases it does not are lucky coincidence.   80% of professional traders perform worse than  amateurs just saving monthly on funds.,1,1743341221.0,2025-03-30 13:27:01

Its for people who do not want to lose money, not for people who want to make as much money as possible.",1,1743360033.0,2025-03-30 18:40:33
1jn98ns,solenico,"It the opposite.  For example, the S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices SPIVA report (which tracks active vs. passive fund performance) consistently shows that over long periods (e.g., 10-15 years), about 80-90% of actively managed funds underperform their benchmark indices (like the S&amp;P 500). Amateurs using DCA into low-cost index funds often mimic the market‚Äôs return, minus tiny fees, while pros face higher costs (management fees, trading costs) and pressure to beat the market, which most fail to do after fees.",1,1743396745.0,2025-03-31 04:52:25

Thats why doge incentivizes temporary trading vs holding because everyone knows holders lose money.,0,1743342022.0,2025-03-30 13:40:22
1jmo09p,Fulvio55,"No. Just NO.  This is the problem with market cap. People look at what‚Äôs actually an imaginary number and think that money changed hands, when nothing could be further from the truth.  In actual fact, it‚Äôs the trades which set the prices. So if two people trade one doge for one dollar, then $1 becomes the spot price which is then multiplied by the number of coins issued to give a market cap. But it only involved a single dollar, not billions.  Of course spot prices only hold until the very next trade, so this isn‚Äôt going to happen in reality. But it can in theory, and has on a few occasions like the six pump and dumps we‚Äôve had.  Regardless, half of all coins have been lost, and most of the rest never move. So the coins churning around are really a tiny subset of all doge.",1,1743376195.0,2025-03-30 23:09:55
1jmo09p,MrKillerKiller_,Price is all that matters. Inflating 5 billion a year means diluting your bag‚Ä¶if you hold for a year. Know this and consider yourself learned.,1,1743379242.0,2025-03-31 00:00:42
1jmo09p,Fulvio55,"Except you‚Äôre wrong.  Doge prices mostly remain steady. It‚Äôs what makes us a superior currency to the more volatile alternatives. And yet, supply increases every minute. Which means the theoretical market cap increases without diluting anything.  It‚Äôs called baking a bigger cake rather than slicing it thinner.  And again, anyone with any sense is trading constantly and really doesn‚Äôt care what prices do.",1,1743393261.0,2025-03-31 03:54:21
1jmo09p,MrKillerKiller_,Its no secret the sole purpose of Doge inflation intentionally devalue the coins over time  and discourage holding. Thats the reason it was designed to devalue over time. Anti hoarding and encourage short term transactions as a ‚Äúmoney‚Äù not an ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù.,1,1743435507.0,2025-03-31 15:38:27
1jmo09p,Fulvio55,"Bullshit!  Where do you get your fantasies from? Fortune cookies?  If you have no clue as to the history of doge, maybe you should do some research instead of spreading manure.",1,1743464522.0,2025-03-31 23:42:02
1jmo09p,MrKillerKiller_,You never knew why Doge was programmed to be inflationary i suppose. But at least you know now right?,1,1743464765.0,2025-03-31 23:46:05
1jmo09p,Fulvio55,"It wasn‚Äôt.  Doge was supposed to self destruct in a year. That‚Äôs why the mining schedule was accelerated.  But Billy made a mistake, and the final block reward never ended. It will continue forever at 10,000 doge per minute.  When the error was discovered, the community chose to NOT ‚Äòfix‚Äô it. If we had decided otherwise, there would be no Dogecoin. It would have disappeared in early 2015.  As I said, do some research, and stop spreading made-up bullshit.",1,1743494703.0,2025-04-01 08:05:03

Another thing i have seen is that wallets with ‚Äúsimiliar address to yours/or similiar address to wallet that you send money too (example a friend wallet )‚Äù will send you some small $, so when you try to send $ somewhere it will show up in recent history and if you do not doublecheck address you might send money to the bad actor.

1kaaowr,Jealous-Captain-6123,It might be address poisoning. There were thousands that fell in this trap only this year (i think 600k was the biggest loss of this kind only this year). The attack looks like this: -You send tokens to an address (0xabcd00000abcd) -The attacker sees that u sent and creates an address with the first and the last digits identical (0xabcd11111abcd) -The attacker sends a sub decimal ammount of tokens that mimic your initial tx  What is attacker purpose: -You copy the initiator address to look for on blockchain (0xabcd1111111abcd) -Ataxker expects that you want to send another tx to your address (0xabcd000000abcd) -Atacker expects to paste the send address you copied before (0xabcd111111abcd) to destination.  As silly as it might seem there were millions stolen like this.  Always beware and double check any tx:),1,1746014621.0,2025-04-30 12:03:41

Especially if there is a big drop before a run, that drop could create liquidity issues that cause a margin call, just to see the price shoot up when the coins are already taken by the lender.",1,1746261854.0,2025-05-03 08:44:14

1kcuwgr,liquid_at,"Lombard loan is not really ""lending your crypto"". you still own it. You just post it as collateral for your loan. Much like your house with a mortgage.   Like all loans, they only make sense if you use them wisely and increase the money, but when you do that, it can make sense to use your crypto holdings to improve your liquidity.   Not the best way. Not recommended for everyone, but still important to understand the difference.  If you lend out your crypto, someone else is working with your crypto and if they fail, you lose. If you take a lombard loan, you are working with the money you got for your collateral and only your own failure makes you lose your crypto.",1,1746339914.0,2025-05-04 06:25:14

1jiwgw9,Ryashi51,"For everybody that keeps saying this is fake   The article you shared, titled ‚ÄúHouse of DOGE Launches Reserve With 10 Million Dogecoin,‚Äù is dated March 24, 2025, and discusses the launch of an ‚ÄúOfficial Dogecoin Reserve‚Äù by the House of Doge, a corporate arm of the Dogecoin Foundation. It mentions a purchase of 10 million Dogecoin to facilitate transactions for global merchants, aiming to improve liquidity and transaction speed. The article also includes a humorous image of a Shiba Inu in a suit, which aligns with Dogecoin‚Äôs meme culture. Is This Real or Fake?  New Information Confirms the Event: Based on recent reports, the House of Doge did indeed announce the launch of the Dogecoin Reserve on March 24, 2025, and purchased 10 million Dogecoin to kickstart the initiative. Multiple sources, including Altcoin Buzz, Bitcoinist, Yahoo Finance, and CoinDesk, have covered this development, confirming the purchase and the goal of enhancing Dogecoin‚Äôs utility as a payment method. The reserve aims to address transaction speed issues, a known challenge for cryptocurrencies, by providing liquidity and enabling instant payments for merchants. Michael Galloro, a member of the Board-Elect of House of Doge, is quoted across these sources emphasizing the reserve‚Äôs role in ensuring ‚Äúliquidity, stability, and reliability‚Äù for Dogecoin transactions. Supporting Details: 	 ‚Ä¢	The Dogecoin Foundation has partnered with House of Doge for five years, designating it as its commercialization partner, which lends credibility to the initiative. 	 ‚Ä¢	The purchase of 10 million DOGE is valued at approximately $1.8‚Äì$1.84 million at current market rates, consistent across reports. 	 ‚Ä¢	Dogecoin‚Äôs price reportedly surged after the announcement, with Yahoo Finance noting a 5% increase and CoinTelegraph reporting a 7% jump, reaching $0.181‚Äì$0.189 on March 25, 2025. This market reaction supports the idea that the announcement was taken seriously by investors. 	 ‚Ä¢	Posts on X also reflect this news, with users discussing the reserve launch and its potential impact on Dogecoin‚Äôs price, further indicating that the event is being discussed in the crypto community. Reasons It Might Seem Fake: 	 ‚Ä¢	The image of a Shiba Inu in a suit with stacks of coins is clearly staged and humorous, which might make the article appear satirical at first glance. However, this aligns with Dogecoin‚Äôs meme-based branding, and the use of such imagery doesn‚Äôt necessarily negate the legitimacy of the news. 	 ‚Ä¢	There‚Äôs some skepticism on X about the transparency of the reserve‚Äîspecifically, the lack of a public wallet to verify the 10 million Dogecoin purchase. Additionally, the House of Doge‚Äôs co-founder, Andrew DeFrancosco, has a 2023 securities fraud conviction, which raises concerns about trustworthiness. However, this doesn‚Äôt disprove the reserve‚Äôs existence; it just highlights potential issues with credibility. 	 ‚Ä¢	The concept of a ‚ÄúHouse of DOGE Reserve‚Äù might sound unusual, as Dogecoin has historically been a meme coin rather than a currency with formal institutional backing. However, the Dogecoin Foundation‚Äôs involvement and the stated goal of improving transaction speed align with broader trends in crypto to enhance real-world utility. Critical Examination: While the event appears to be real, there are reasons to approach it with caution. The lack of transparency regarding the reserve‚Äôs wallet, as noted in X posts, is a valid concern in a decentralized ecosystem like cryptocurrency, where trust is often built on verifiable actions. Additionally, Dogecoin‚Äôs inflationary model (with 5.2 billion new coins added annually) could undermine its long-term value as a reserve currency, as pointed out by CoinGape. This contrasts with Bitcoin‚Äôs fixed supply, which is often seen as a better fit for a reserve asset. Furthermore, the involvement of a figure with a securities fraud conviction could signal potential governance issues within House of Doge, which might affect the initiative‚Äôs success.  Conclusion: The article is real in the sense that the House of Doge did announce the launch of the Dogecoin Reserve on March 24, 2025, with a 10 million Dogecoin purchase, as corroborated by multiple credible sources. The goal of facilitating transactions for global merchants by improving liquidity and transaction speed is consistent across reports. However, the humorous image and the lack of transparency about the reserve‚Äôs holdings, combined with concerns about the organization‚Äôs leadership, might make it seem less serious or trustworthy. While the initiative is legitimate, its long-term impact and credibility remain uncertain, and the crypto community‚Äôs mixed sentiment reflects that. If you‚Äôd like to dive deeper into the House of Doge, Dogecoin‚Äôs market performance, or the feasibility of this reserve, let me know!",1,1743076360.0,2025-03-27 11:52:40

I realized that I haven't made a single straight-up uncompromising, absolutely balls-to-the-wall Dogecoin hype song yet.  With all of the craziness and drama going on around us, sometimes it's easy to forget that we're still VERY much at the vanguard of this technology. And as silly and fun and brimming with heart as it is, Dogecoin still offers a legit escape from a system of control that we've had zero say over for pretty much our entire existence.  So if this song's message seems a bit chaotic at times it's because I've tried to wrap as many of amazing reasons that we're all here together and put it under the hood of this flaming beast.  Whether you're here for the Ludicrous Financial Gains or not, there's a lot on offer for Dogecoin and I hope this song helps to get you feeling just a bit hyped up and remember, for whatever reason that is, why you're here.  Today's song is LFG!! and I hope it helps to get you hyped up for the world beyond tomorrow that we're building together! üòÜüòÅ  Much Love,  GoodShibe",0,1743165316.0,2025-03-28 12:35:16

1kf0st9,Fulvio55,"The point is the fee has nothing to do with the amount.  You could send a billion doge and it will cost exactly the same as sending one doge.

1kf0st9,Fulvio55,"First of all, there are no ‚Äògas‚Äô fees. Doge is NOT a token. It has its own blockchain.  Transaction fees are 0.001 Doge per thousand bytes. Which is about six UTXOs (inputs). If you do your own transactions using coinb.in (do use a local copy so you can sign offline and not risk exposing your keys), this is all you need to pay.  However, if you use a client, a much higher fee is likely hardcoded into it. Typically at least 1 Doge.  And if you use a third-party service, they can charge whatever they feel like. Some exchanges have been known to charge as much as 50 Doge. So check the fees before you sign up.",1,1746415635.0,2025-05-05 03:27:15

1jx9gs5,liquid_at,"Doge traditionally trades slightly downwards for extended periods of time, only interrupted by massive jumps upwards.  Once you reach 1c, moves between 0.0001c and 0.0002c will look like a flat line, despite having represented +100% moves in the past. Just compared to the 1c it does not mean anything.   logarithmic view compensates for that. A move from 0.0001 to 0.0002 will look much closer to a move from 1c to 2c or a move from 10c to 20c.   In this view, anything that happened before the current ATH that was created in 2021 is just a flat line with nothing to see. Given that doge is trading in 4 year cycles, looking at only the last cycle and nothing but the last cycle is not a good way to determine if it is a good long term investment.",3,1744472506.0,2025-04-12 15:41:46

1k8ka70,Boon_Rebu,"No one shows inflation charts in 10-year segments, reads as inflation % per year to your average person.  Show a chart with increase in supply per year for proper display of deflationary supply.  Spiking the percentage from 2020 at 0% to 39% is also incorrect for chart making.  It should start in 2020 with the 2020 number from the previous 10-years.   28B/100B/0.6 to account for only 6 years in circulation for that 10-year period = 47%  Breaking it down into PER YEAR segments shows that DOGE is already lower than real-life inflation of FIAT globally.  As there are 149B coins outstanding, and 5B new coins made per year, this years increase in supply is 5/149 = 3.35%",1,1745700742.0,2025-04-26 20:52:22

1k81ti2,liquid_at,It's a common mistake of beginners to only look at ATHs and ignore everything else. It's what usually confuses the living crap out of them and prevents them from making smart decisions.,1,1745667867.0,2025-04-26 11:44:27

1k81ti2,liquid_at,"Everything else...  The value of a peak is always depending on the temporary hype levels at that short period in time.   Solid floors that keep resisting over weeks, months and years are not just an emotion of the moment, like ATHs are, but actual establishe values that majorities in the market respect.
