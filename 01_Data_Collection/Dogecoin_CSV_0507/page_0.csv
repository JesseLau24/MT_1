You use your dollar to buy stocks and have no problem with it not being dollars.  You can buy NFTs with doge. You can convert doge into any other asset that you want to invest in and when you're done with it, convert your profits back to doge.   Do not look at doge like another crypto, look at doge like another dollar.   You use doge to buy things. That's its purpose.

1i7sici,liquid_at,"Almost as if the idea that Elon somehow influenced Dogecoin was a meme the fanboys of Musk told themselves that had no evidence backing it.  Fanboys looked out of the window, saw the neighbor running with a newspaper above their head and it starting to rain, so they concluded: ""When the neighbor runs with a newspaper over his head, this triggers rainfall"" ...  The only reason the price of Doge went up after Musk first mentioned it is because you and the other fanboys bought it. And when SNL happened, those same fanboys sold at a loss, increasing the dump.  All they ever did was temporarily increasing the price, so that trading firms can take the fanboys money. This is all that has happened.

1kel6o1,Peterlemonjello1972,Cup and handle resistance support are all fake things look up Steve Mauro Jo Jo Charles MMM. If any of these indicators worked there would be way more millionaires trading. Don‚Äôt believe the main stream trading indicators support resistance Fibonaccis all that junk it‚Äôs more simple 3 levels reset then 3 more direction etc is more involved but cup and handle is for soup or tea not trading.

1kel6o1,liquid_at,"Like I said... I do not own any bitcoin, so I do not have a meme coin.   But if you think WIF is a coin, you should look up the difference between coins and tokens. It's pretty much like money and casino tokens. The casino giving you real money if you cash it in, does not make it money.
