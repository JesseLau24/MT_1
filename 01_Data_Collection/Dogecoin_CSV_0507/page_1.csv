1kf0st9,Fulvio55,"The point is the fee has nothing to do with the amount.  You could send a billion doge and it will cost exactly the same as sending one doge.  The fee is based on the amount of space your transaction takes in the blockchain. Every 1,000 bytes will cost you 0.001 doge.",1,1746466739.0,2025-05-05 17:38:59
1kf0st9,Fulvio55,"First of all, there are no ‚Äògas‚Äô fees. Doge is NOT a token. It has its own blockchain.  Transaction fees are 0.001 Doge per thousand bytes. Which is about six UTXOs (inputs). If you do your own transactions using coinb.in (do use a local copy so you can sign offline and not risk exposing your keys), this is all you need to pay.  However, if you use a client, a much higher fee is likely hardcoded into it. Typically at least 1 Doge.  And if you use a third-party service, they can charge whatever they feel like. Some exchanges have been known to charge as much as 50 Doge. So check the fees before you sign up.",1,1746415635.0,2025-05-05 03:27:15

This might sound like a bad thing. But heres how I think about it. There are thousands ot crypto currencies out there, and even the top 10 struggle to compete with bitcoin. Just look at ethereum.   So the way I see it, what we really are getting is a way to ride the bitcoin wave instead of diversifying investments into the knock offs. And at an actually affordable price.

The only way anyone can make money off this coin is by riding the hype train and getting little yoohoos like you to buy thinking the coin is going to explode, then use your little investment as their exit liquidity. Which is why the whales are trying to hype so hard and spread random bs. Good luck though man. You might make some money. Grab that profit while you can.
