1k0l28y,liquid_at,"Dogecoin can no longer be mined with GPUs. Scrypt is such a specialized and demanding algorithm, that only ASICs (= special hardware designed to do one function only) are the only reasonable way to mine dogecoin.  If you want to utilize your GPU for something related to crypto, there are some mining sites that choose which coin to mine for you, while you choose which coin you want to be paid with.   And I'd definitely recommend to read up on crypto, because it is not untraceable. It is the opposite, very traceable. (if it is not a privacy coin). You just cannot determine the ownership of the wallets.  So if you move coins from Wallet A to Wallet B, no one can tell who the owners of Wallet A and Wallet B are. Could be you moving coins from one of your wallets to another of yours, or could be someone paying a 3rd party. No one knows who the owners are if the owners do not identify themselves.",4,1744827467.0,2025-04-16 18:17:47

1jzhhen,liquid_at,"Imho, if you wanted to drive wallets to the next level, any wallet-manager that allowed you to have a main account that manages the rights for different wallets and who gets to have access.  That way you could combine cold wallets with hot wallets and give users a ""money manager"" that allows them to choose what part of their coins they want to keep live and what they want to store.   But you should leave the idea of ""one wallet"" behind. If you have 100% of your coins in one wallet, all it takes is one wallet to be compromised for you to lose 100% of your property.   It's a human instinct to keep things tidy in one spot, but when it comes to security, that's a terrible idea.",3,1744708426.0,2025-04-15 09:13:46
1jzhhen,Tyguy047,That‚Äôs a really good idea. I could potentially find a way for the user to have one receive wallet and then that will distribute funds to a bunch of smaller wallets and when you send funds it pulls from all the sub wallets.,1,1744738573.0,2025-04-15 17:36:13
1jzhhen,liquid_at,"that's definitely an option. You just need to consider safety.   If your main wallet has all the private keys from all your other wallets, hacking that one wallet will give the attacker access to all wallets.   I'd compartmentalize it to a degree where it can be used freely by the owner, but any access point being compromised (except for the root one) would still not mean that all funds can be drained.   But of course, you could set up a system that keeps your spending-wallet topped with a certain amount every 24h. This would ensure that you have always spending money around, but prevent anyone from stealing more than this amount within 24h if they happen to get access.   I think those types of systems that help owners of crypto to stay in control but make it harder for attackers to take over are definitely needed.",1,1744739505.0,2025-04-15 17:51:45

And not a single one where such measures kept bad guys out.  Besides‚Ä¶ show me a virus that hunts for random file names on devices which are almost never connected. Or which search for doge keys.  And if you‚Äôre truly paranoid, it‚Äôs not hard to ‚Äòmassage‚Äô your keys, say by segmenting them and inserting garbage characters in the gaps.  I actually ran several competitions here, one with a million doge prize, challenging people to crack keys. They knew exactly what they were looking for, and it still took an inordinate effort. Effort which no one is going to put into hunting for wallets which may or may not contain anything, let alone worthwhile sums.

Any wallet you cannot read with your very own eyeballs is going to cost you sooner or later. And pretty much all clients prevent or make it difficult to see your keys.  So if you want a project, abandon this idea. Instead, get involved with the coinb.in project and make it better than it already is. It isn‚Äôt a client and doesn‚Äôt take custody of your wallets, but many people are unable or unwilling to learn how transactions are built, so they see it as a hurdle in its current form.
