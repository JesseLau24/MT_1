1jzcnj2,Fulvio55,"Price and value are completely different things.  Say you find a coin in your change that is special. Maybe an error. Maybe a rare date. Whatever.  Its value is what it says on it. But its price could be thousands, even millions, if you found someone prepared to pay.  Doge is the same. Its value is what you can do with it. Its price is what someone agrees to pay for it.  Oh, and marketcap, while handy for comparing cryptos, is meaningless. It‚Äôs just the price multiplied by the total number of coins ever mined. There is absolutely no consideration of coins lost, burnt or otherwise no longer available.",2,1744675174.0,2025-04-14 23:59:34
1jzcnj2,liquid_at,"""value"" can be many things at the same time. A coin might have the nominal value assured by the government that issued it, but that government can also be gone. The material in itself, especially when it is silver or gold, does have material value. If the coin is specifically well produced there might even be artistic or collector value. If it came from an interesting time in history, that also might be value.  ""price"" is what anyone is willing to pay.   If you take your coin to the bank, they will give you the nominal value and that will be the price.  If you take it to a museum, they might value it high, but won't pay you, so the price is nil.   And if you find a crazy collector, your price might be significantly higher than the sum of all values.",1,1744707410.0,2025-04-15 08:56:50
1jzcnj2,Fulvio55,"It‚Äôs not hard to make money from coins. Or many other things. Stamps, toys, crockery, cameras, even computers. Look up what an Apple Lisa is worth for example.  The trick is to recognise what you have or have access to. For example, I once met a guy who was scooping up old women‚Äôs magazines for free or a few cents each, then cutting them up and selling individual full page ad pages for $5 each. He couldn‚Äôt keep up with demand.  When it comes to crypto, and especially Doge, there‚Äôs the price which determines your ability to trade or spend, and the intangible of the value of holding and participating here for example.  In my mind, the value here far exceeds any money my coins might be worth. What value do trading skills you can learn cheaply have? You can apply those skills to anything and make serious money in any market.",1,1744762128.0,2025-04-16 00:08:48

These idiotic ‚Äòwhale‚Äô reports are simply exchanges moving coins around as part of their normal operations, that‚Äôs all.  Also, there‚Äôs another generally overlooked fact. If the price stays constant, the market cap will still increase because those new coins increase the supply. So an arbitrary price today is actually greater than the same price previously.  In time (and no, we won‚Äôt live that long) we‚Äôre going to overtake everything that has a cap on it. Particularly considering they will cease to exist if they don‚Äôt remove their caps.
