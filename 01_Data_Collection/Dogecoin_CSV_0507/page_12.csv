1jx9gs5,liquid_at,"Doge traditionally trades slightly downwards for extended periods of time, only interrupted by massive jumps upwards.  Once you reach 1c, moves between 0.0001c and 0.0002c will look like a flat line, despite having represented +100% moves in the past. Just compared to the 1c it does not mean anything.   logarithmic view compensates for that. A move from 0.0001 to 0.0002 will look much closer to a move from 1c to 2c or a move from 10c to 20c.   In this view, anything that happened before the current ATH that was created in 2021 is just a flat line with nothing to see. Given that doge is trading in 4 year cycles, looking at only the last cycle and nothing but the last cycle is not a good way to determine if it is a good long term investment.",3,1744472506.0,2025-04-12 15:41:46
