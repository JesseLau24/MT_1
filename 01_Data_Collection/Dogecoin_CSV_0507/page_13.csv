These people are the ones who will sell at a loss, or, if they are lucky, will hit their ""break even point"" and dip out.   Or, OP is in league with the ""market forces"" that come to manuplate sentiment on social media, so those people with big pockets can snatch up even more coins at a cheaper price.
