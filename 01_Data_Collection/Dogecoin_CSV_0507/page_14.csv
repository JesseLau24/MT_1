Doge is considered a currency type coin that is fast in transaction speed and cheap! Several big name companies and sports teams take doge as payment! I guess some traders like to think they can influence others to invest in their project thinking its going to cause it to spike and they can sell for profits but they are fools!

How many times in the past 4 years has it gone from like 10 cents to 30 cents?
