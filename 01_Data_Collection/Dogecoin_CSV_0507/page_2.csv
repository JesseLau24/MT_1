1kcuwgr,Fulvio55,"#This is an amazingly bad idea!  Take it from someone who lent 11 Bitcoins and never saw them again.  And a similar thing happened with the nearly 1 billion doge in our original tipbot, which were ‚Äòborrowed‚Äô just before a price spike made it impossible to replace them.  Sorry, but it‚Äôs exceptionally risky to borrow or lend crypto in any way, shape or form. You can easily lose everything, and there is absolutely no redress possible.",2,1746188391.0,2025-05-02 12:19:51
1kcuwgr,liquid_at,"I don't think OP is talking about borrowing or lending, but a lombard loan, where you get money by offering a collateral in form of stocks or crypto.   Still a bad idea, since any volatile move in value to the downside would immediately risk a margin call, but still different from borrowing or lending. Much like pawning your stuff for a short term liquidity boost, the main risk is not being able to repay the loan.   Especially if there is a big drop before a run, that drop could create liquidity issues that cause a margin call, just to see the price shoot up when the coins are already taken by the lender.",1,1746261854.0,2025-05-03 08:44:14
1kcuwgr,Fulvio55,"Yeah, everything to do with borrowing/lending in any form is a very bad idea.  I‚Äôll never understand why these people don‚Äôt do even a tiny bit of searching and find all the sob stories from people who‚Äôve been caught out by this stuff.",1,1746321777.0,2025-05-04 01:22:57
1kcuwgr,liquid_at,"Lombard loan is not really ""lending your crypto"". you still own it. You just post it as collateral for your loan. Much like your house with a mortgage.   Like all loans, they only make sense if you use them wisely and increase the money, but when you do that, it can make sense to use your crypto holdings to improve your liquidity.   Not the best way. Not recommended for everyone, but still important to understand the difference.  If you lend out your crypto, someone else is working with your crypto and if they fail, you lose. If you take a lombard loan, you are working with the money you got for your collateral and only your own failure makes you lose your crypto.",1,1746339914.0,2025-05-04 06:25:14

1kcuwgr,liquid_at,"sure. The only difference is that in one you are the lender and in one you are the borrower.   The actions that make you lose your money are your own in one case and some strangers in another.

The fact that not much is currently happening comes down to price and greed. The high price makes it risky to both accept and spend, and greed says hoard it because it‚Äôll be worth more tomorrow. Which of course kills commerce.  It‚Äôs the same with gold, BTW. Nobody in his right mind would spend gold when the price has tripled in recent years, and is going ballistic because of the orange imbecile and his crazy ideas. That‚Äôs not the fault of gold or of the people who own some. And the same applies to doge.  Oh, and massive adoption is never going to happen.
