1jok2h7,C300w204,"Nice question , lot of different takes on m2 money supply.  one could argue it is a lagging indicator but in my opinion it is a lazy analysis. There are times that bitcoin and m2 money supply are more correlated and times that they are not.  Market is complex and there is not a correct take on it.   As one of my experienced frader friends once told me, there are times that we have to focus on what we have right now and not what will happen next.    My opinion on the market is that tariffs are widely priced in, risk assets are currently pricing in the unclarity  around tuesdey/wednesday announcements. There is unclarity and there is fear. Also believe there are more people interestied in chasing longs then shorts from here, many were preserving wealth and chose not to participate.  one way to find out  Do only good everyday",1,1743472550.0,2025-04-01 01:55:50

At some point as a man you have to smarten up and stop making decisions with your feelings involved. You want an easy way out but truth is there is no easy way unless you’re born into a successful family whose had a plan laid out for you from the beginning. Right now you’re finding comfort in people that are gambling just like you that will eventually fuel your addiction further.

1jn94xb,jeremiahcp,"Dogecoin tends to follow Bitcoin’s price movements, but it’s unlikely to experience the same long-term growth. Despite the widespread “to-the-moon” enthusiasm, Dogecoin was originally designed as a currency for everyday transactions, not a long-term investment asset. Its inflationary supply model means that new coins are continuously added to circulation, preventing it from serving as a reliable store of value.  Bitcoin, by contrast, has a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins, making it inherently deflationary over time. This scarcity, along with growing institutional adoption, has solidified Bitcoin’s reputation as a store of value or “digital gold.” Historically, Bitcoin has outperformed most other asset classes over the long term.  If you’re investing with a long-term perspective, it’s generally wiser to allocate more to Bitcoin and less to Dogecoin. Avoid making investment decisions based on social media hype; stay objective and focus on the fundamentals when managing your portfolio.",12,1743345631.0,2025-03-30 14:40:31

1jn94xb,TimeTravellingCircus,"Your principle investment would only reach 51k after 3 years, but not a lump sum, rather with a contribution time frame.  At a 15% rate of return each year, at the end of the 3rd year, you'd roughly hit a 100k portfolio at the end of your 3 year contribution time frame.  Considering that were expecting a crypto summer and winter both within the next 3 years.  You might balance those events to the equivalent of a 15-25% smoothed out growth rate over those 3 contribution years.  Then there's 7 more years of holding, which could also contain another crypto summer and winter.  I'd again rather factor a steady growth as the sum effect of those events, rate rather than account for windfalls and perfect timing.  Again just using a smooth 15% rate of return would put you at a quarter million at the end of 10 years.  No you won't be a millionaire.  Buying meme coins requires you to have had a sizeable holding before any specific market events occur and your daily contribution strategy doesn't really give you that leverage.  You'd likely experience the first crypto summer sometime soon from now, with very little held in those assets.  You'd be then ""betting"" on another crypto summer shortly after you reach maximum contribution at the end of 3 years.",2,1743352272.0,2025-03-30 16:31:12
