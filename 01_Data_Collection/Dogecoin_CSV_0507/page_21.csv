1jn98ns,solenico,DCA is only viable strategy especially with volatile investments.,9,1743332067.0,2025-03-30 10:54:27
1jn98ns,Issastake,Correct brother,6,1743332174.0,2025-03-30 10:56:14
1jn98ns,liquid_at,"By definition it is just a strategy that tries to average your buy-price to remove volatility.  This will lead to you buying at roughly the 50% level and is a safe strategy, not a profit-oriented one.  DCA can easily be optimized by changing fixed times of purchase to time-slots in which you try to get a temporary low to buy, as well as taking profits on runs that happen after a dip-buy.   DCA is just the easiest and safest method to use for beginners that do not understand crypto and do not have the ability to predict prices. It's not ""the only viable strategy"" though. Just the one a beginner with no understanding of anything is most likely to be able to work.   It's not a bad strategy, but if you tell yourself some fantastic stories about it being the only option there is, you are limiting yourself.",1,1743332570.0,2025-03-30 11:02:50
1jn98ns,solenico,It‚Äôs only option besides luck.,1,1743338038.0,2025-03-30 12:33:58
1jn98ns,liquid_at,"If you have no other methods, that's what makes you a beginner, yes. It is significantly better than luck. But it doesn't mean that better, yet more complex and riskier solutions exist. You just have to know and understand them fully, before they become a better alternative.  But never fool yourself by thinking things don't exist simply because you don't know about them. The world is bigger than your head.",1,1743338323.0,2025-03-30 12:38:43
1jn98ns,solenico,There‚Äôs is other methods of course. But if we have fully functional market as per studies in the long run DCA results overdrive everything else.   The few cases it does not are lucky coincidence.   80% of professional traders perform worse than  amateurs just saving monthly on funds.,1,1743341221.0,2025-03-30 13:27:01
1jn98ns,Issastake,Yea man investment is very simple buy at good price and hold .,2,1743342342.0,2025-03-30 13:45:42
1jn98ns,liquid_at,"It is mathematically proven that when you DCA in and DCA out, your expectation is 50% of the long-term gains.  It's the safe route. Not the route for profits. Its for people who do not want to lose money, not for people who want to make as much money as possible.",1,1743360033.0,2025-03-30 18:40:33
1jn98ns,solenico,"It the opposite.  For example, the S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices SPIVA report (which tracks active vs. passive fund performance) consistently shows that over long periods (e.g., 10-15 years), about 80-90% of actively managed funds underperform their benchmark indices (like the S&amp;P 500). Amateurs using DCA into low-cost index funds often mimic the market‚Äôs return, minus tiny fees, while pros face higher costs (management fees, trading costs) and pressure to beat the market, which most fail to do after fees.",1,1743396745.0,2025-03-31 04:52:25

Then when it hits bottom ride it back up with a long. Love when the market is bleeding like crazy cause there is so much money that can be made from shorts.   But the tariffs are helping, it‚Äôs going to cause the market to be far stronger in the future because of how many manufacturing jobs they are bringing into United States. Once these people get these jobs and are making money guess where their money is going? Into the market. Stop thinking so short term, long-term these tariffs are going to make us a ton of money. In the meantime if you want to make money now, learn how to trade not just buy and hold. By the dips and sell the peaks at the very least.

1jmo09p,MrKillerKiller_,When you hear about ‚Äúrisk on‚Äù market conditions is when memes run to ath areas. Problem is Doge is so inflationary it would take like $56 Billion more dollars just to reach the same price,-1,1743282730.0,2025-03-29 21:12:10
1jmo09p,Fulvio55,WTF are you on about? Clearly you have no idea how markets work. Market cap does not mean that much money was paid by anyone. You could skyrocket the cap with a single $1 trade in theory.,1,1743302675.0,2025-03-30 02:44:35
1jmo09p,MrKillerKiller_,Im saying it will take $56 billion MORE dollars just to reach the same all time high price than it did when it was at that price last time. Thats how this meme is designed to lose value of each coin over time. They flood the market with 5 billion coins every year diluting the price of anyone trying to ‚Äúhold‚Äù. Thats why doge incentivizes temporary trading vs holding because everyone knows holders lose money.,0,1743342022.0,2025-03-30 13:40:22
1jmo09p,Fulvio55,"No. Just NO.  This is the problem with market cap. People look at what‚Äôs actually an imaginary number and think that money changed hands, when nothing could be further from the truth.  In actual fact, it‚Äôs the trades which set the prices. So if two people trade one doge for one dollar, then $1 becomes the spot price which is then multiplied by the number of coins issued to give a market cap. But it only involved a single dollar, not billions.  Of course spot prices only hold until the very next trade, so this isn‚Äôt going to happen in reality. But it can in theory, and has on a few occasions like the six pump and dumps we‚Äôve had.  Regardless, half of all coins have been lost, and most of the rest never move. So the coins churning around are really a tiny subset of all doge.",1,1743376195.0,2025-03-30 23:09:55
1jmo09p,MrKillerKiller_,Price is all that matters. Inflating 5 billion a year means diluting your bag‚Ä¶if you hold for a year. Know this and consider yourself learned.,1,1743379242.0,2025-03-31 00:00:42
1jmo09p,Fulvio55,"Except you‚Äôre wrong.  Doge prices mostly remain steady. It‚Äôs what makes us a superior currency to the more volatile alternatives. And yet, supply increases every minute. Which means the theoretical market cap increases without diluting anything.  It‚Äôs called baking a bigger cake rather than slicing it thinner.  And again, anyone with any sense is trading constantly and really doesn‚Äôt care what prices do.",1,1743393261.0,2025-03-31 03:54:21
1jmo09p,MrKillerKiller_,Its no secret the sole purpose of Doge inflation intentionally devalue the coins over time  and discourage holding. Thats the reason it was designed to devalue over time. Anti hoarding and encourage short term transactions as a ‚Äúmoney‚Äù not an ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù.,1,1743435507.0,2025-03-31 15:38:27
1jmo09p,Fulvio55,"Bullshit!  Where do you get your fantasies from? Fortune cookies?  If you have no clue as to the history of doge, maybe you should do some research instead of spreading manure.",1,1743464522.0,2025-03-31 23:42:02
1jmo09p,MrKillerKiller_,You never knew why Doge was programmed to be inflationary i suppose. But at least you know now right?,1,1743464765.0,2025-03-31 23:46:05
1jmo09p,Fulvio55,"It wasn‚Äôt.  Doge was supposed to self destruct in a year. That‚Äôs why the mining schedule was accelerated.  But Billy made a mistake, and the final block reward never ended. It will continue forever at 10,000 doge per minute.  When the error was discovered, the community chose to NOT ‚Äòfix‚Äô it. If we had decided otherwise, there would be no Dogecoin. It would have disappeared in early 2015.  As I said, do some research, and stop spreading made-up bullshit.",1,1743494703.0,2025-04-01 08:05:03
