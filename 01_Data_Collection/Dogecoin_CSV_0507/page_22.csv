1jltvb6,GoodShibe,"New Song Time!  Happy Friday, everyone! We made it to the end of week #15 of this crazy ride and you know what?   I realized that I haven't made a single straight-up uncompromising, absolutely balls-to-the-wall Dogecoin hype song yet.  With all of the craziness and drama going on around us, sometimes it's easy to forget that we're still VERY much at the vanguard of this technology. And as silly and fun and brimming with heart as it is, Dogecoin still offers a legit escape from a system of control that we've had zero say over for pretty much our entire existence.  So if this song's message seems a bit chaotic at times it's because I've tried to wrap as many of amazing reasons that we're all here together and put it under the hood of this flaming beast.  Whether you're here for the Ludicrous Financial Gains or not, there's a lot on offer for Dogecoin and I hope this song helps to get you feeling just a bit hyped up and remember, for whatever reason that is, why you're here.  Today's song is LFG!! and I hope it helps to get you hyped up for the world beyond tomorrow that we're building together! üòÜüòÅ  Much Love,  GoodShibe",0,1743165316.0,2025-03-28 12:35:16
