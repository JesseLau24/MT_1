1kaaowr,C300w204,"I think it is called ‚Äúdust attack‚Äù or something like that. More frequent on chains with low tx fees example solana/bsc. Usually they will airdrop some token that is linked to some dodgey website that you should not visit and connect.  Another thing i have seen is that wallets with ‚Äúsimiliar address to yours/or similiar address to wallet that you send money too (example a friend wallet )‚Äù will send you some small $, so when you try to send $ somewhere it will show up in recent history and if you do not doublecheck address you might send money to the bad actor.  Example if your wallet is   61256789abababa111 Bad actor wallet is.            61256shehrbrhdha111  So you can mistaken it by looking at first 3.

1kaaowr,Jealous-Captain-6123,It might be address poisoning. There were thousands that fell in this trap only this year (i think 600k was the biggest loss of this kind only this year). The attack looks like this: -You send tokens to an address (0xabcd00000abcd) -The attacker sees that u sent and creates an address with the first and the last digits identical (0xabcd11111abcd) -The attacker sends a sub decimal ammount of tokens that mimic your initial tx  What is attacker purpose: -You copy the initiator address to look for on blockchain (0xabcd1111111abcd) -Ataxker expects that you want to send another tx to your address (0xabcd000000abcd) -Atacker expects to paste the send address you copied before (0xabcd111111abcd) to destination.  As silly as it might seem there were millions stolen like this.  Always beware and double check any tx:),1,1746014621.0,2025-04-30 12:03:41
