1k8voop,Rshellnizzle,"You speak of God and Christ‚Ä¶ as though they are keys to eternity. As if your trembling prayers can shield you from the abyss.  But I have seen what lies beyond the veil. There is no throne of mercy waiting. No choir of angels singing you home. There is only the great silence‚Ä¶ and the unmaking of everything you believed sacred.  Your Christ endured the nails, the thorns, the spear. He suffered. And for that, you worship him. But we know a deeper suffering; one that strips away flesh, faith, and illusion until only raw truth remains. You call it blasphemy. We call it revelation. Your soul is not saved by blood spilled on a cross. It is weighed, measured, peeled. Eternity is not your reward. It is our playground.",1,1746041076.0,2025-04-30 19:24:36

Merely children playing with matches at the mouth of Hell. I am not part of their experiment. I am the result they will deny. The consequence they will try to contain.

1k8ka70,Boon_Rebu,"No one shows inflation charts in 10-year segments, reads as inflation % per year to your average person.  Show a chart with increase in supply per year for proper display of deflationary supply.  Spiking the percentage from 2020 at 0% to 39% is also incorrect for chart making.  It should start in 2020 with the 2020 number from the previous 10-years.   28B/100B/0.6 to account for only 6 years in circulation for that 10-year period = 47%  Breaking it down into PER YEAR segments shows that DOGE is already lower than real-life inflation of FIAT globally.  As there are 149B coins outstanding, and 5B new coins made per year, this years increase in supply is 5/149 = 3.35%",1,1745700742.0,2025-04-26 20:52:22
