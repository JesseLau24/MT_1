1k44dnm,Fulvio55,"Yes, walletgenerator has been compromised twice that we know of.  In one instance there was a clone site that phoned home with all the wallets it generated. We mounted a concerted effort to flood it with millions of wallets until it was taken down, which took a few days.  In the other case there was a bug where it was reusing the same wallets repeatedly. That one was fixed fairly quickly as well.  This is an open source project, and anyone could download the code and run it in preference to using the live site.  I generally advise people to generate thousands of bulk wallets and to let them stew for as long as possible before using any of them randomly. For immediate needs, coinb.in will generate single wallets which you can do offline on your own copy, not the live site.  I think you may have fallen victim to one of the two instances above. I think a blanket warning isn‚Äôt warranted though. All wallets are identical, and how you generate them is irrelevant. The risk is not in the methodology but in someone else having access to the keys either through compromised code, in transit, or through malware on your devices.  I‚Äôm sorry for your loss.
