I am not condoning or making excuses, but Id like to offer some possible theories to why it is this way:  -There are troll and spam accounts who intend to manipulate public perception, one way or another, by either spreading undeserved fear to scare off new investors, or spreading undeserved hype to attract new investors, depending on whatever agenda they might have. These are the ‚ÄúI CAN GUARANTEE WE HIT $100 BY NEXT WEEK‚Äù or the ‚ÄúSELL NOW! GET OUT! CRYPTO IS DEAD AND WILL NEVER RECOVER‚Äù type comments and posts. Especially the newer accounts with shorter post history. Also look out for the accounts that seem to suddenly switch personalities halfway through their post history, which have likely been account-farmed, or stolen.   -Dogecoin‚Äôs association with Elon Musk and Donald Trump have added in some political sentiment to the community. Whether or not the association to Musk is real or just perceived, the emotion of politics is still spilling into this sub.  -Because it‚Äôs the internet, it‚Äôs easier to just unleash all the pent up emotion by lashing out on complete strangers. Youre not talking to a human, you‚Äôre talking to a Reddit Snoo with silly clothes, and a wall of text. Maybe even a bot or two. It‚Äôs easy for people to forget the human behind the other screen.  -Repetition might be annoying to some people, and instead of muting the sub, or just downvoting and moving on, they have to jump in to bully or complain every time they see a similar topic get posted more than once. Or they think they are attacking one the aforementioned troll accounts, but they are accidentally just attacking a genuine newcomer with legitimate questions.",2,1742177137.0,2025-03-17 02:05:37

People forget the absolute crap show that was the post MTGox era. Doge was fresh, friendly, and worth fractions of a cent. It democratized crypto for a lot of folks. Now, there are still the old school 1 doge = 1 doge folks, but there seems to be WAY more people chasing some insane hope that their 4675 doge will make them rich. They believe (or at least hope) it will hit $5, $10, $100, or, new to me, even $2000. We've become the toxic community, and anyone who says doge is not a great investment gets labeled a hater, or accused of spreading FUD, or a BTC shill. Frankly, it is sad and pretty disappointing.

There are the pre-Musk people, dating back to 2013.  And then there are the post-Musk people who rushed in and paid insane amounts for their coins in the expectation of becoming filthy rich with zero effort.  When the bubble burst, that latter group got caught holding very expensive bags. In some cases their life savings which they foolishly threw in. This group also subscribe to the truly idiotic HODL mentality, not realising it was coined as a sarcastic joke, not as a game plan to riches.  So they constantly post garbage about prices, complete with stupid screenshots and absolutely zero content of any value whatsoever. Thee people seriously think the coin is going to be worth a mythical dollar sometime tomorrow, and are happy to do nothing to improve their situation.  It‚Äôs a bit like the priest in a flood, who refused rescue by multiple boats and helicopters only to drown. When he arrived at the pearly gates and complained about god not helping him, god said ‚ÄúI sent you boats and helicopters, and you refused them all‚Äù.  If these people bothered to learn to trade, they would all have completely free coins, just like all the pre-Musk people do. Then they wouldn‚Äôt care about what prices do, and might make this place fun again, like it used to be a decade ago.  Thank you for your quality post.

1jcyujm,Commercial_Ease8053,I think you should make better investments. Over the last entire year it‚Äôs only up 0.018 cents haha. Not even 2 cents. How is this a smart investment whatsoever?

1jcyujm,GoodShibe,Hi there!  I'll give you the same advice I gave to OP: you can clean up your feed quite a bit by reporting and/or blocking trolls and other bad actors when you see them.  Hope you find that helpful!  GoodShibe,2,1742171371.0,2025-03-17 00:29:31
