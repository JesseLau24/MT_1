1jedexy,Bored-Finance-Bro,I feel like there are competing priorities here. Most on this sub want to see dogecoin go to moon. But on the other hand they all cheer its adoption as payment. If doge price keeps going up why would anyone want to spend doge to buy something? And if they dont use it as payment then whats the value of doge as store of value/commodity?  Genuinely want to understand this.  This is in general true for crypto so not arguing for another crypto. I just dont get why crypto is good investment.,3,1742337596.0,2025-03-18 22:39:56

Don‚Äôt know anything about the guy, but Sodexo is a very large food service vendor that supplies and managers food servicing and foodstuff at many institutions, places of entertainment, and many universities. Have no idea what this is suggestive of, but could imagine they may have a vision of seeing Dogecoin as a way to pay for food in those contexts. Makes me think of how at some universities there might be ‚Äòbucks‚Äô of some kind you can buy and then use to redeem. But in this case probably someone noticed that dogecoin might serve a similar purpose. A downside of the redeemable coupons is that they generally cannot be used for anything outside a restricted context. On the other hand, dogecoin is crypto so it can be useful beyond say buying food.

1jea279,TimeTravellingCircus,"Here's the thing about crypto, it doesn't carry the kind of friction a commodity or equity has.  Commodities are backed by the physical asset, and equities are backed by the earnings potential of companies.  You can call it friction or momentum.  It takes effort to move and effort to swing the other direction.  Crypto is closer to ""frictionless"". It has the potential to spin up and down much faster.  It can reach a 15T market cap on just trading volume and sentiment alone, it doesn't need to produce a physical asset or an earnings outcome. Technically the market cap of any asset can behave this way, but our ingrained trading mentality says there are theoretical caps to the value of commodities and equities based on their physical counterparts. With crypto there is no physical counterpart, the value is virtual by nature.  Additionally the market cap and the bid/ask price are measurements of where the next incremental trade occurs, it doesn't mean that equivalent amount of money was invested into that asset, nor can you extract that amount of money from the sale of the asset.  Whether this is good or bad is a different story, but I don't care as I'm here betting on the market sentiment ratcheting up like it has done time and time again.",1,1742370605.0,2025-03-19 07:50:05

1jea279,TimeTravellingCircus,"Right, you're the smart one, who expects crypto to behave like traditional assets. Understood.  We live in a world of Trillions now, and as time marches forward we'll be living in a world of Quadrillions and then Quintillions.  Those are unstoppable facts of systemic inflation, capital markets and debt structures.  Btw, you know how prices work right? If people continue to believe the increasing price of an asset has value to them, and are willing to pay the increasing price per unit, the price can continue to rise.  I never said it's guaranteed, and I simply put forth an argument for what forces are different in crypto vs traditional assets.  But you just came back with insults and no reasoning. Because I guess you're so smart.",0,1742398424.0,2025-03-19 15:33:44

Lol If you want a currency with existing mass acceptance that can be utilized globally in exchange for goods & services, there is a solid incumbent meeting all these criteria called CASH/USD! Why the hell would businesses start accepting #dogecoin? Businesses are going to spend millions/billions on new infrastructure so you can:  1. Exchange cash/USD + FEES to obtain dogecoin that is useless & can't be spent.  2. When needing to spend, you then exchange Dogecoin + FEES to get cash back that can be spent.     If people are dumb enough to do that, no businesses are going to step up and help facilitate the transactions on your behalf so THEY CAN NOW PAY THE FEE TO CONVERT IT TO CASH! Lol They know if you want to buy something through them, you can use cash. THE SAME CASH YOU STARTED WITH BEFORE SWAPPING IN & OUT WHILE PAYING FEES JUST TO GET BACK TO WHERE YOU STARTED!

You need suckers to inject cash (buy the dip) & then NOT sell (HODL) so the operation doesn't go bust w/ sudden, uncoverable CASH WITHDRAWALS! Because like any variation of a PONZI SCHEME, there isn't enough cash to pay a fraction of withdrawals! Who in the real-world is eager to trade their CASH for a useless token?! There is no $26 BILLION U.S DOLLAR EQUIVALENT MARKET CAP FOR DOGECOIN! That's part of the scam--once again connecting their 'currency' to the existing ACTUAL currency that isn't going away--EVER! There is limited cash held by the Founders that quietly retained 70% of available outstanding coins at ICO! They can manipulate the spot price without remorse leaving you with NO RECOURSE when you bust (and you will it's a closed, zero-sum control market where every $1 DOLLAR they make in profit is covered by a $1 DOLLAR lose by a someone being scammed). If you think it's a cooperative community where EVERYONE cares about the best interests of others in the community, well you are probably just a good person that was scammed, lied to and now don't want to swallow your pride & admit you got taken. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS COOPERATIVE COMMUNITY INVESTING WHERE EVERYONE GETS RICH IF YOU ALL STAY DISCIPLINED AND JUST ""DON'T SELL"". That's the most egregious & perpetuated aspect of the scam that takes advantage of GOOD people. You can't work together to manipulate the spot price so everyone is a WINNER! The people telling you this are the ones controlling the fake control market! They are telling you to be a team player & don't hurt the community while they are ROBBING YOU!       I saw another u/ ask another why he/she is still here if they aren't going to be a believer & team player?! I can't speak for that u/ BUT THE REASON I AM STILL HERE IS BECAUSE I CAN'T SIT BY AND WATCH GOOD PEOPLE GET CRUSHED & LOSE EVERYTHING! I am not a hater nor do I have any financial stake in trying to protect you! That's such a silly concept. If I or anyone wants to get in on the magical, amazing Dogecoin investment, THERE ARE 14,400,000 ADDITIONAL DOGECOINS MINED & RETAINED DAILY W/ NO CORRESPONDING CASH BUY IN!!! Yeah not hard to find a way in for those branded haters. The founders don't want you to know how it works because if you do it's ""GAME OVER, MAN. GAME OVER.""  SUMMARY: Anyone that wants additional free, objective evidence that outlines the scam just respond and I will hook you up. I don't want you to believe me & my evidence (although it's üíØ verified & undeniable). DON'T TRUST ANYONE. READ, STUDY, ASK QUESTIONS (DON'T BE SHY! NOT EVERYONE DOES THIS FOR A LIVING AND KNOWS HOW ALL THE COMPLEXITIES WORK LIKE I DO! I know accounting, data science, micro/macro economics, financial markets, game theory, etc. BUT I CAN'T CHANGE MY OWN OIL LIKE MANY OF YOU CAN VERY EASILY. NOPE I GO TO THE EXPERTS BECAUSE I KNOW I DON'T KNOW CARS & MECHANICS! I hope I reach a few people and they get out before it's too late. This is NOT a victimless crime!! People are investing their futures & they have people counting on them for the future!      Imagine having to tell your daughter she has to pull the plug on the dream wedding you've been working for & wanting to give her since the second she came into the world. Then you have to tell her you also brought her fiancee in on the investment because it seemed so good, but now it's ALL GONE & CAN'T BE RECOVERED. Trust me this is HEARTBREAKING, DEVASTATING real-world pain that destroys lives, fuels depression & even suicides for those feeling responsible. They weren't gullible, dumb suckers, scammers or BAD people that deserved what they got. In fact, just the opposite. They often see the best in people & trust easily because they themselves are good & just want to help others, but end up burning everyone.",-5,1742309629.0,2025-03-18 14:53:49

1je49ug,bodog9696,"   You are correct, but I don't have a better term for the early jostling of Dogecoin from originally having a fixed supply of 100 billion √ê in Dec 2013 before announcing in Feb 2014 that it switched to an unlimited, but throttled supply model. By mid-2015 less than 2 years after launch all 100 billion √ê had ALREADY been mined. An important detail that seems to be left out of either the program code &/or inconsistent time frames provided for its history. [All of the initial 100 billion √ê were mined by mid 2015 despite shifting to the unlimited, throttled limit of 5 billion  √ê 14 months prior?] I was not aware of the paradigm shift when auditing the coin so it threw me off by 90 BILLION √ê!   We can argue semantics & terminology, but I agree with you ICO is not the best description despite the original rules at INITIAL COIN launch being drastically different. With INITIAL COIN OFFERING (ICO) now being a formal , technical term that means something different, I need to avoid that. Regardless the rapid initial influx established a MASSIVELY skewed outstanding coin total to the 'early adopters', then they hit the brakes on supply flow making it IMPOSSIBLE TO REBALANCE THE DISTRIBUTION OVER THE YEARS. IT PUT LATER INVESTORS AT THE MERCY OF THE TOP GROUP THAT EXPLOITED THE SITUATION!*  [100 BILLION COINS MINED IN 1.5 YEARS, BUT ONLY AN ADDITIONAL 58 BILLION COINS TOTAL OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS! THAT'S HOW MARKET MANIPULATION IS LEVERAGED & WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED IN LEGITIMATE, REGULATED TRADITIONAL EXCHANGES.]  Before wasting more time with numbers & technical aspects, it's easier to just listen to BILLY MARKUS & JACKSON PALMER on the state of the coin they founded. Palmer quickly recognized the exploitation scam that was occurring AND LEFT CRYPTO CURRENCY FOREVER IN 2015. He has since spoken out in disgust and warns people of the scam!! The founder openly discusses the scam and his disgust, yet people still think it's legit. Maybe it's just his opinion?! Nope. Billy Markus was asked if Palmer's findings & disgust was true & he confirms its validity! Markus also got the hell out of DOGE in 2017 being disgusted.  Here's a little summary visual I had for dogecoin that covers all of this.  It's not made up nor hard to find. It's easily available on Wikipedia for anyone to read & research, yet obviously most people didn't go that route.   https://imgur.com/a/I34rTDW",0,1742326882.0,2025-03-18 19:41:22
