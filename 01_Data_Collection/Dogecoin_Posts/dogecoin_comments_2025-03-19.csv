1jf47e5,goomyman,"Why the f would you think that.   What can you buy with doge.   How is doge better than actual money,  or different than other coins.    I mined 700k doge in 2 days on Christmas with a gaming pc when it first came out.   I gave it all away when this subreddit was a meme - things like 1 doge = 1 doge.   If people posted doge memes you could get 100 doge for fun from doge wallets because 100 doge was like 10 cents.    Soon my doge wallet on the subreddit was stolen,  twice.  Because the people running it ran away with the coins.  Like for practically nothing but I guess a lot of nothing adds up.  I probably lost 100k coins plus and gave away another 100k.  Seeing the theft of these joke coins just turned me off.   I ended up giving it all away to doge car and doge meme socks for the homeless because the subreddit started turning to a typical Ponzi scheme get rich quick ploy from a fun and playful get into crypto coin.   The meme car was funny.   At the time before Elon started manipulating the doge market the total value of my coins was under 100 dollars - which honestly was about 90 dollars too much.   I gave my coworker friend 10k coins to play around with for fun - it was maybe - few dollars.  He probably still has them - and would have made more money off doge because I made zero.   This coin was literally a 100% clone of lite coin which went open source with the decimal point moved over.   Instead of .001 bitcoin it would be 1000 doge!   Bigger number is better plus meme.   Also I think it had ( has? ) a bug that causes inflation - which is pretty neat for a coin but I have no clue if the gamblers running the coin now decided to fix that.   It has no value.  It still has no value.  At the same time I mined doge I also mined coinye west.   What makes doge more valueable than coinye west.  Absolutely nothing.   Its value used to be the community now its dogestreetbets.   There is no value in this coin.   Or any of these coins.   They are just get rich quick schemes ‚Ä¶ but if your not the one with millions of real dollars manipulating the market your not the one who is getting rich quick.     wtf is wrong with people.   Dont try to get rich quick off a scam coin.  Yes I‚Äôm calling doge coin a scam coin,  just like all crypto coins except a handful that do actual things.    I didn‚Äôt make any money off this coin,  I just helped it gain popularity by funding the memes but at the time it was funny,  now I regret being part of a coin costing people their livelyhoods on speculative gambling.",0,1742429241.0,2025-03-20 00:07:21
