1jfyozm,FinalHeaven88,"This is kinda my beef with crypto as a currency in general. $1 to $1 makes sense, but the whole 1 Doge = 1 Doge doesn't add up to be very consistent pricing for goods or services.  If I get a meal for 150 Doge at .15 per doge, it's a little over 20 bucks -cool! But if the meal costs 150 Doge, and the price for Doge pumps to .8 the next day, then the same meal suddenly costs $120. Would prices fluctuate to follow the dollar, or how would this be addressed? I guess it could just calculate the dollar cost and ask for the amount of Doge needed to cover it, but the price can still change a lot within an hour or two.

In many cases, you're then talking about paying above average prices for a payment/financial service who will do that, or are manually taking the crypto seperately and then converting it meaning you would either be stuck holding or doing it daily. The merchant would likely, in any case, be holding for some period of time regardless increasing their risk exposure in fields where margins are often tight already.

1jfbzqm,Just-Hood,It's not worth the inflation and taxes. Invest in coin futures or options. Coin volatility has stabilized. In direct fluctuations with the s&p. Look at an actual graph for fluctuations of price over s&p and alt coins... Exactly the same. You're buying nothing. With nowhere to use it.,1,1742488170.0,2025-03-20 16:29:30

1jfbywr,Extension-Lie-3272,Everyone is on 420. This is why crypto gets a bad rep. No the cycle is over. It crashed back in December. I started crypto in 2017. I held all this time and I never saw it this low. For the first time I actually lost money. Just wait and see once Bitcoin crashes further you are all going to see 70-90% down. Crypto won't vanish but it's definitely not gonna pump and remain very low for a very long time.,-1,1742629428.0,2025-03-22 07:43:48
