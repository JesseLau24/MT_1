1jgpyqe,slykethephoxenix,"> is there a way to generate the private key for the specific DOGE address that the funds were sent to?   Lol, let me know if you figure that out.  But realistically, it's a lost cause. You could steal anyone's Dogecoin if you could generate the private key for an address.

For example look at the 2024 breakout and then a breakdown over the year, may people had shorts from the top of the .22 that got hyperliqudated on the next push up, that's is part of the reason we teleported on the next surge is because the trapped liquidity acted as jet fuel for the next rally.

1jg4bfw,DD4LIFE8,"Fact, you lost a lot of money by not selling. Imagine how much money you would now have if you sold the peak in 2021, then bought the dip that followed after. And then continued to buy and sell the dips/peaks this entire time.   Fact, you don’t make (or loss) money if you just hold. You have to sell to make money.   Everyone needs to get out of the mentality of holding makes you rich, it doesn’t anymore. Trading makes you money. Sure you’ll make some money holding it long term but it’s a tiny amount in comparison to what you could make if you were actively trading it.  Trading your crypto. Then take those profits you made to build up your portfolio to a level you want to trade with. Once that goal is made, all further profits should be then moved into a dividend stock. This is how the average Joe becomes rich and can retire early and with a lot of money.   This is also how you create generational wealth. Because you can simple live off of the passive income the stock generates and off the profits you make from trading crypto. Then when you die, you can pass that onto your kids and they can continue to live off the passive income while building the capital even more as to generate more passive income.   But go on ahead and hold, watch it grow to new heights and brag about how much in profit you are. Then keep holding and watch as the next 3 years it drops and is a fraction of what it was. Rinse and repeat this every 4 years. Sure in 30-40 years you will have made a lot of money vs the initial investment but it would be a drop in the bucket compared to what you could of made and you won’t be leaving much wealth for you’re children, money that sits is money wasted. Make your money work for you. Actively trade and invest into things that generate passive income.",5,1742575653.0,2025-03-21 16:47:33
