1jh16sj,Sinnedangel8027,"My take. If you're looking to make a quick buck on Robinhood, it will be bottoming soon if not already hitting the bottom at $0.16. However, it skyrocketing again will be difficult due to the negative outlook on the DOGE organization in the US government.  People are not super intelligent when it comes to crypto and public perception. Regardless of the no affiliation between doge crypto and DOGE government. Most folks (those who are not crypto associated or knowledgable) just see the word ""doge"" and associate it with the government.   Crypto is very volatile in general and on principal due to the low amount of real-world uses at the moment.  All that being said. Doge will likely rise again, given time. If that 13k is burning a hole in your pocket, you don't need it for anything else nor want to invest it in more traditional investment vehicles, and you're willing to hold onto that doge for possibly the next few years.
