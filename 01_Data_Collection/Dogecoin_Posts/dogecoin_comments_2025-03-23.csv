1ji5311,N/A,"sure.  so you see where the red line starts, thats a local high, buyers pushed price there , then did not think dogecoin was worth more so stopped buying, the sellers took control and dumped to the lowest value people thought it might be good to buy at.  look at the future when price again gets dumped at that price point, the 3rd time, theres been a shift in sentiment of buyers, for some reason buyers think dogecoin IS worth more than this price, and so price breaks this barrier, we return to this barrier and people watch to see what everyone thinks, people decide it IS worth more and refuse to sell, then the buying continues until like before at our local maximum, people dont think it's worth more, then like the local maximum, sellers begin dumping as if people dont think its worth more then its a good time to sell.  price returns to this previous area where sellers decided it WAS worth more, same as in the local support area where sellers stopeed selling, and now we can see that the sellers , who think they can get a better sell value , and buyers who think they can buy cheap might start getting in.  I've also added a LRC , linear regression channel with outer layers of 2nd standard devition, the data points in the LRC account for about 90% or so ( google it ) corrolated values, what this means is that, 90% of the data over that period is contained in the LRC, price broke out of that, that shows that this is a significant change in price movement as it is uncorrolated with previous movement, this LRC break alongside the return to the switch point ( resistance turned to support ) , made me take my precious $50 ( im canadian so i'm poor ) and buy dogecoin and HODLE THE FKIN LINE HOOOOOOOOOLDDDDD  edit : oh I'm a very advanced day trader / analyst ( haven made money yet tho ) despite how i'm communicating , I use inversion as part of my analysis for some psychological and analytical enhancement, its not relevant here, my chart just always looks like this.  edit2: HoDLLL THE LINEEEEEE",3,1742754132.0,2025-03-23 18:22:12
