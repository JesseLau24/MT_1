1jkwpqg,markwoei,"I was looking at the Indy 500 Sponsorship thing and thought that maybe as a community we should try something that hasn't done before?   So for example: it would cost some amount of $$ or €€ to buy some commercial or other way of showing Doge to the public. If then every owner books some amount of Doge to get to the goal of being able to buy that commercial space or whatever, everyone could benefit of it when the price would go up. So we as owners of Dogecoin can do something for our own benefit.. Doesn't sound that bad. Only thing is you need to find a trustworthy person/company/whatever that can handle everything for a certain fee offcourse..",3,1743089940.0,2025-03-27 15:39:00

I don't like Dogecoin being associated to DOGE and making it political because I don't think it's helping at all. But you have to recognize that he helped the coin get attention and any implementation in the future of Doge either in Tesla or other companies will just help it to get more mainstream and acceptance.

So much going for dogecoin, it's still top 8 crypto in the entire world.   The entire crypto market is being manipulated heavily. They are trying to shake out everyone so they can get it all for cheap. It's been happening since the beginning. Just have to be patient. All the whales are buying millions of coins because they are getting ready for a HUGE rally. They know something we don't.   Please, get your head on straight and keep holding and don't give up.
