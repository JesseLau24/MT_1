1jmolcj,Revolutionary_Emu154,"December of 2017, BTC reached 19k, and then it crashed all the way down to 4k. 2019, it reached 10k, that's when I buy in. When it went to 13k, I sold and thought it would go back down to 10k. It went to 60k. We all know the story. 60k crashed to 40k, went back up to 60k, reached 100k, and now around 80k. Decide for yourself. Sell when you need to, and you won't have regrets. Hold until you can retire, and you will have one less problem to worry about(hopefully that problem is money)",7,1743265061.0,2025-03-29 16:17:41

1jmo09p,MrKillerKiller_,Im saying it will take $56 billion MORE dollars just to reach the same all time high price than it did when it was at that price last time. Thats how this meme is designed to lose value of each coin over time. They flood the market with 5 billion coins every year diluting the price of anyone trying to “hold”. Thats why doge incentivizes temporary trading vs holding because everyone knows holders lose money.,0,1743342022.0,2025-03-30 13:40:22

1jmo09p,Fulvio55,"No. Just NO.  This is the problem with market cap. People look at what’s actually an imaginary number and think that money changed hands, when nothing could be further from the truth.  In actual fact, it’s the trades which set the prices. So if two people trade one doge for one dollar, then $1 becomes the spot price which is then multiplied by the number of coins issued to give a market cap. But it only involved a single dollar, not billions.  Of course spot prices only hold until the very next trade, so this isn’t going to happen in reality. But it can in theory, and has on a few occasions like the six pump and dumps we’ve had.  Regardless, half of all coins have been lost, and most of the rest never move. So the coins churning around are really a tiny subset of all doge.",1,1743376195.0,2025-03-30 23:09:55
1jmo09p,MrKillerKiller_,Price is all that matters. Inflating 5 billion a year means diluting your bag…if you hold for a year. Know this and consider yourself learned.,1,1743379242.0,2025-03-31 00:00:42
1jmo09p,Fulvio55,"Except you’re wrong.  Doge prices mostly remain steady. It’s what makes us a superior currency to the more volatile alternatives. And yet, supply increases every minute. Which means the theoretical market cap increases without diluting anything.  It’s called baking a bigger cake rather than slicing it thinner.  And again, anyone with any sense is trading constantly and really doesn’t care what prices do.",1,1743393261.0,2025-03-31 03:54:21
1jmo09p,MrKillerKiller_,Its no secret the sole purpose of Doge inflation intentionally devalue the coins over time  and discourage holding. Thats the reason it was designed to devalue over time. Anti hoarding and encourage short term transactions as a “money” not an “investment”.,1,1743435507.0,2025-03-31 15:38:27

1jmo09p,Fulvio55,"It wasn’t.  Doge was supposed to self destruct in a year. That’s why the mining schedule was accelerated.  But Billy made a mistake, and the final block reward never ended. It will continue forever at 10,000 doge per minute.  When the error was discovered, the community chose to NOT ‘fix’ it. If we had decided otherwise, there would be no Dogecoin. It would have disappeared in early 2015.  As I said, do some research, and stop spreading made-up bullshit.",1,1743494703.0,2025-04-01 08:05:03
