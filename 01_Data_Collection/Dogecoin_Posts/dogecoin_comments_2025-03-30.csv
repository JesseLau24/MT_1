1jnard9,jeremiahcp,"Cryptocurrencies are considered risk assets, and when there’s uncertainty in the market, those are usually the first to get sold off. This is part of a process called de-risking, where investors move their money into safer options like bonds, gold, or cash to avoid losses.  But when confidence returns, investors tend to re-risk by putting money back into higher-risk, higher-return assets like crypto. The more obscure or fringe a cryptocurrency is, the more volatile it tends to be during these market swings. While some coins can have occasional independent price spikes, most of them follow the overall market flow, usually tracking Bitcoin’s direction.",4,1743347492.0,2025-03-30 15:11:32

1jn98ns,liquid_at,"By definition it is just a strategy that tries to average your buy-price to remove volatility.  This will lead to you buying at roughly the 50% level and is a safe strategy, not a profit-oriented one.  DCA can easily be optimized by changing fixed times of purchase to time-slots in which you try to get a temporary low to buy, as well as taking profits on runs that happen after a dip-buy.   DCA is just the easiest and safest method to use for beginners that do not understand crypto and do not have the ability to predict prices. It's not ""the only viable strategy"" though. Just the one a beginner with no understanding of anything is most likely to be able to work.   It's not a bad strategy, but if you tell yourself some fantastic stories about it being the only option there is, you are limiting yourself.",1,1743332570.0,2025-03-30 11:02:50

1jn94xb,jeremiahcp,"Dogecoin tends to follow Bitcoin’s price movements, but it’s unlikely to experience the same long-term growth. Despite the widespread “to-the-moon” enthusiasm, Dogecoin was originally designed as a currency for everyday transactions, not a long-term investment asset. Its inflationary supply model means that new coins are continuously added to circulation, preventing it from serving as a reliable store of value.  Bitcoin, by contrast, has a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins, making it inherently deflationary over time. This scarcity, along with growing institutional adoption, has solidified Bitcoin’s reputation as a store of value or “digital gold.” Historically, Bitcoin has outperformed most other asset classes over the long term.  If you’re investing with a long-term perspective, it’s generally wiser to allocate more to Bitcoin and less to Dogecoin. Avoid making investment decisions based on social media hype; stay objective and focus on the fundamentals when managing your portfolio.",13,1743345631.0,2025-03-30 14:40:31

1jn94xb,TimeTravellingCircus,"Your principle investment would only reach 51k after 3 years, but not a lump sum, rather with a contribution time frame.  At a 15% rate of return each year, at the end of the 3rd year, you'd roughly hit a 100k portfolio at the end of your 3 year contribution time frame.  Considering that were expecting a crypto summer and winter both within the next 3 years.  You might balance those events to the equivalent of a 15-25% smoothed out growth rate over those 3 contribution years.  Then there's 7 more years of holding, which could also contain another crypto summer and winter.  I'd again rather factor a steady growth as the sum effect of those events, rate rather than account for windfalls and perfect timing.  Again just using a smooth 15% rate of return would put you at a quarter million at the end of 10 years.  No you won't be a millionaire.  Buying meme coins requires you to have had a sizeable holding before any specific market events occur and your daily contribution strategy doesn't really give you that leverage.  You'd likely experience the first crypto summer sometime soon from now, with very little held in those assets.  You'd be then ""betting"" on another crypto summer shortly after you reach maximum contribution at the end of 3 years.",2,1743352272.0,2025-03-30 16:31:12

1jn94xb,blindguywhostaresatu,Realism isn’t hating.   It’s simple supply and demand. Meme coins like doge constantly add new coins with no cap on how many can be in circulation. By design it’s unlikely to reach significant value due to adding 5 billion new coins a year. Whereas something like bitcoin can because it has a set amount cap that can ever be in circulation.   That doesn’t mean you can’t make some money from doge but there are other far better options to make more money and in a more efficient manner even within the crypto space.,1,1743368780.0,2025-03-30 21:06:20
