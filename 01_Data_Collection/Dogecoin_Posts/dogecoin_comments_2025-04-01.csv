There are times that bitcoin and m2 money supply are more correlated and times that they are not.  Market is complex and there is not a correct take on it.   As one of my experienced frader friends once told me, there are times that we have to focus on what we have right now and not what will happen next.    My opinion on the market is that tariffs are widely priced in, risk assets are currently pricing in the unclarity  around tuesdey/wednesday announcements. There is unclarity and there is fear. Also believe there are more people interestied in chasing longs then shorts from here, many were preserving wealth and chose not to participate.  one way to find out  Do only good everyday",1,1743472550.0,2025-04-01 01:55:50
