1jpggfi,Dangerous_Pension612,Right here is what matters . This meme is all about the people making purchases that generally have no idea what crypto even is or does. People that made spur of the moment purchases because somebody told them to ..having never even looked at a single chart or doing any research. Research is the moat important thing when investing in crypto ( or anything ) and it seems like most people here don‚Äôt do that. If they did they wouldn‚Äôt be posting about how the coin is ‚Äú going to the moon‚Äù when it‚Äôs up 3%.,1,1743610707.0,2025-04-02 16:18:27
