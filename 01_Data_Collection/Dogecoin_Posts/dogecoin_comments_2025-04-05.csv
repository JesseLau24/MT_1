1js7z5t,nightfly82,More than 350k coins. What id like to do?  Well depends on the price. Ideally in a great world I‚Äôd like to see it reach a dollar. If it does I will easily sell 300k. After taxes who knows what I will actually end up with. Hopefully half I‚Äôd give a few friends and family a few bucks as a gift. The rest I would put into something like a bond or something really safe. Got 12 more years till retirement so that‚Äôs more or less my down payment $ for retirement home down the road At this point if we get back up to 50 cents I will take some profits and hold on to the cash for a few then maybe invest it  Strange times ahead,2,1743879545.0,2025-04-05 18:59:05

1jrtaxp,DankShibe,"1.7 mil doge in 2013-14 was like $200. I could have bought the same amount or more back then but I spent all my money on YuGiOh cards instead and now I only have a 1/10th of what he has, which i bought 6-7 years ago and so i ll stay poor because i didn't swing trade at April 2021 and December 2024 :/.",2,1743948744.0,2025-04-06 14:12:24
