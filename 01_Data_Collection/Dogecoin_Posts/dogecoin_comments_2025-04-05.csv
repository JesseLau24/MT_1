1jsbdi0,nightfly82,I hear ya but a 401k/retirement wasn’t meant to drop 20% in 2 days lol supposed to be a more or less safe haven.

1js9pcv,xxfallen420xx,What u mean to say is that the exchanges will be forced to tap out when the banks they have borrow money from to short the crypto on the exchange they operate decide to margin call them and get their money back. This will cause forced buy ins that drastically raise the price. Another way to think of a short position from a buyers pov is a discount.,0,1743880534.0,2025-04-05 19:15:34

1js7z5t,nightfly82,More than 350k coins. What id like to do?  Well depends on the price. Ideally in a great world I’d like to see it reach a dollar. If it does I will easily sell 300k. After taxes who knows what I will actually end up with. Hopefully half I’d give a few friends and family a few bucks as a gift. The rest I would put into something like a bond or something really safe. Got 12 more years till retirement so that’s more or less my down payment $ for retirement home down the road At this point if we get back up to 50 cents I will take some profits and hold on to the cash for a few then maybe invest it  Strange times ahead,2,1743879545.0,2025-04-05 18:59:05
1js7z5t,nightfly82,Still waiting on “house of doge” to post adoption news. I think it’s going to be a big nothing burger. But they are teasing meeting with real world companies about adoption for doge.  I did use it once to buy pizza in NYC  Other than that I dunno what else I would buy with it? Maybe clothing?  We will see if real world adoption happens. Not holding my breath. Like I said. Next run up I will take profits and not worry as much about this coin,2,1743881172.0,2025-04-05 19:26:12

1jrtaxp,DankShibe,"1.7 mil doge in 2013-14 was like $200. I could have bought the same amount or more back then but I spent all my money on YuGiOh cards instead and now I only have a 1/10th of what he has, which i bought 6-7 years ago and so i ll stay poor because i didn't swing trade at April 2021 and December 2024 :/.",2,1743948744.0,2025-04-06 14:12:24
