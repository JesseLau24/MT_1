1jujlt3,Bitcoin_Chaca,"We are short sighted when trading crypto. I am down $30,000. I bought Dogecoin at $.42 and have no money to DCA. I bought up Dogecoin because of the four year cycle. I expected it to have this parabolic rally by the end of May at the latest. I was picturing Lamborghinis and paying cash for a house blah blah blah. I’m doing the best I can to have the mindset to just buy and hold. I thought about deleting my Robinhood app and not looking at it for a year. A buddy of mine did that with bitcoin. He bought several years ago and literally deleted the app and didn’t look at it for three years and made a lot of money so you will too.

There is literally nothing you could have found out researching doge, that would have told you that the price would go down, because it wasn't doge that dropped, but the Fiat-Economy.   The only way you had to know that the market would drop would have required insider information from the current US administration, long before they were even inaugurated.

1jujlt3,capofliberty,Been there. Had to hold for 3 years at a loss but it came back. When it did I doubled my money and sold. I read somewhere that less than 2% of people profit from crypto which was a reason enough to sell. You’re in the holding game now. The other option is to get your money out at a loss and buy some good stocks. No better time to buy now. When they turn around you’ll definitely get your money back and then some.

Either, op is one of those people who wanted to get rich quick, that never did any research about where they are choosing to put their money, and now that there is a down period they are freaking out. These people are the ones who will sell at a loss, or, if they are lucky, will hit their ""break even point"" and dip out.   Or, OP is in league with the ""market forces"" that come to manuplate sentiment on social media, so those people with big pockets can snatch up even more coins at a cheaper price.

1ju0ava,dracokingz,Crypto should be independent from the stock and global market and yet here we are.,1,1744326222.0,2025-04-10 23:03:42
1ju0ava,csbagley,As its always been! Go figure! Apparently you are new!,1,1744326991.0,2025-04-10 23:16:31
1ju0ava,dracokingz,I dont think you understood. Read my last post again. If its independent from the stock and global markets then explain why the mentioning of tariffs trigger one of the biggest sell off we have seen in past couple of years??,1,1744327151.0,2025-04-10 23:19:11
1ju0ava,csbagley,Because my meaning to my statement is that it has never been independent from global markets! The same thing driving crypto (traders) are the same thing driving global markets (traders) so when bad news comes about then they all panick sell!,1,1744327307.0,2025-04-10 23:21:47

1jtzdg0,Fulvio55,"Too easy…  Go to coinb.in. Download a copy so you can run it locally offline.  Fire it up, fill in the boxes, sign the transaction, broadcast. Done.  Everything other than loading the UTXOs and broadcasting can and should be done offline.  And by the way, you don’t need actual paper for a wallet. A text file is much more convenient, just store it on removable media and never have it online.  You can find ELI5s and lots of detailed explanations if you do some searching. Start with ‘text wallet’.",1,1744158059.0,2025-04-09 00:20:59
