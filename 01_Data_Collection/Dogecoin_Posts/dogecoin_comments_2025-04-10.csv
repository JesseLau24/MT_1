1jvtv0h,thedukeofprescott,"Okay - this may be the wrong sub, but…  I had 2 huskies growing up. You can’t stop them. It’s not that they’re smarter than you (depends on the husky and the human), they are determined. We had an electric fence, turns out it turns off a certain distance outside the fence. We had a permanent fence, they went under that. Hell, they were inside one day and the dug through the floor and escaped through the crawl space. We weren’t even gone for a half hour!   Lesson is, love them, feed them, put a tracker on them and a chip in them, and then buy some DOGE while you wait for them to come home.",1,1744326033.0,2025-04-10 23:00:33
