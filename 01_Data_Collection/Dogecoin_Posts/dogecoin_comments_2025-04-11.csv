1jwsmpq,liquid_at,"ATH is a pointless metric. Once you realize that focusing on ATH is only going to make sure that you are desperate for 3.5 years with extreme hype for 6 months, that ends in disappointment every single time, you either sell all your assets at a loss, or you learn that looking at ATHs is stupid.  It's a common beginner mistake.",0,1744452225.0,2025-04-12 10:03:45

1jwgewp,natasevres,"Dollar crashing.  Albeit on purpose - which is worrying as hell. But as it is now crashing, doge Will inevetible go up.  But lets not confuse hyper inflation with increased value on doge. (Atleast not in shortterm).  What Will be interesting though is if we see increased crypto adoption in the US, similiar to what we have seen in south american countries like Argentina and Venezuela.  However, this also means that the biggest financial global currency is going to become so unreliable that fullscale dumping also Will occur.",-3,1744364766.0,2025-04-11 09:46:06
