1jxk7yw,Fulvio55,"Agreed.  However as I told OP, nobody ‚Äòbought‚Äô 80 mil at all. These idiotic ‚Äòwhale‚Äô reports are simply exchanges moving coins around as part of their normal operations, that‚Äôs all.  Also, there‚Äôs another generally overlooked fact. If the price stays constant, the market cap will still increase because those new coins increase the supply. So an arbitrary price today is actually greater than the same price previously.  In time (and no, we won‚Äôt live that long) we‚Äôre going to overtake everything that has a cap on it. Particularly considering they will cease to exist if they don‚Äôt remove their caps.

Once you reach 1c, moves between 0.0001c and 0.0002c will look like a flat line, despite having represented +100% moves in the past. Just compared to the 1c it does not mean anything.   logarithmic view compensates for that. A move from 0.0001 to 0.0002 will look much closer to a move from 1c to 2c or a move from 10c to 20c.   In this view, anything that happened before the current ATH that was created in 2021 is just a flat line with nothing to see.
