Any wallet you cannot read with your very own eyeballs is going to cost you sooner or later. And pretty much all clients prevent or make it difficult to see your keys.  So if you want a project, abandon this idea. Instead, get involved with the coinb.in project and make it better than it already is. It isn‚Äôt a client and doesn‚Äôt take custody of your wallets, but many people are unable or unwilling to learn how transactions are built, so they see it as a hurdle in its current form.

If your main wallet has all the private keys from all your other wallets, hacking that one wallet will give the attacker access to all wallets.   I'd compartmentalize it to a degree where it can be used freely by the owner, but any access point being compromised (except for the root one) would still not mean that all funds can be drained.   But of course, you could set up a system that keeps your spending-wallet topped with a certain amount every 24h. This would ensure that you have always spending money around, but prevent anyone from stealing more than this amount within 24h if they happen to get access.
