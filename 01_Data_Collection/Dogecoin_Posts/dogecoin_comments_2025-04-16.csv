1k0l28y,liquid_at,"Dogecoin can no longer be mined with GPUs. Scrypt is such a specialized and demanding algorithm, that only ASICs (= special hardware designed to do one function only) are the only reasonable way to mine dogecoin.  If you want to utilize your GPU for something related to crypto, there are some mining sites that choose which coin to mine for you, while you choose which coin you want to be paid with.   And I'd definitely recommend to read up on crypto, because it is not untraceable. It is the opposite, very traceable. (if it is not a privacy coin). You just cannot determine the ownership of the wallets.  So if you move coins from Wallet A to Wallet B, no one can tell who the owners of Wallet A and Wallet B are. Could be you moving coins from one of your wallets to another of yours, or could be someone paying a 3rd party. No one knows who the owners are if the owners do not identify themselves.",3,1744827467.0,2025-04-16 18:17:47

1k0l28y,ozziesironmanoffroad,"I mined doge back in 2021 with a GeForce 2080 super. I would mine eth then exchange it for doge. In 10 months I got about 600 doge from mining all day every day, only stopping to game or if windows did an update and rebooted.   And that was then‚Ä¶. I tried mining again back in December and even in a pool with a Radeon 6900xt, I let it mine for a week and didn‚Äôt get anything.

1k0l28y,liquid_at,"I'm not a miner myself but there are plenty of miner subs out there that give you their experience.   All you have to do is pick the one that seems most trustworthy and avoid taking the one that promises you the biggest gains, especially if they promise you multiples of the trustworthy ones.  Scammers usually try to apeal to your greed. Crypto Investors protect themselves by doing their own research.   It's a new asset class. Either you're willing to do research or you have to wait until it is no longer a new asset class... Those are the 2 options.",3,1744874748.0,2025-04-17 07:25:48
