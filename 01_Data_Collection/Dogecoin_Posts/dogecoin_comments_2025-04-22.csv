Many people view it as a meme, just as many took it as an actual serious investment, which is why now you have so many trying their hardest to fill the bag they got left with.",1,1745397853.0,2025-04-23 08:44:13
1k57xha,liquid_at,"Dogecoin is a serious investment.  Dogecoin memes are for fun.  They have nothing to do with each other.   One is the currency on the blockchain that is boring because it is just money and the other is the culture of the community that likes to have fun while they wait for years and decades of growth.   Taking memes as financial advice is a mistake that can only happen if you listen to the memes of other subs that tell you the lie about dogecoin investors thinking that memes are financial advice. Memes are just jokes. Nothing more.   So if you dislike that you fell for the idea that memes are real, tell the subs that fooled you into thinking this how you do not appreciate it... We around here never told anyone that memes are financial advice. You can't blame this community for what other communities did to you.",0,1745399455.0,2025-04-23 09:10:55
