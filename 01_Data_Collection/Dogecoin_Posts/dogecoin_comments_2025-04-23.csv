If you‚Äôre looking for an investment, why not just park your money in securities that are revenue driven and backed by a product/service that investors are confident in? I don‚Äôt understand the crypto thing. It seems more like a collectible. Something people buy because they‚Äôre not confident enough to invest in the stock market, it‚Äôs cheap and it‚Äôs something to stare at. I‚Äôve asked friends and it‚Äôs always some half baked elusive response in an attempt to justify their hopes of a moon shot. Personally, I make more in one month of options premiums than any of my friends have made in crypto trading over the past 4 years. It just makes no sense to me.
