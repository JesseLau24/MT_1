The charts mirror each other pretty well total percentages gained in a day doesn’t mean squat because even if DogeCoin went to $1.00 and stayed there permanently it still wouldn’t topple BTC in any way…the price per coin sets the dominance and it all depends on max supply until another coin comes along with less max supply it won’t topple BTC,1,1745685309.0,2025-04-26 16:35:09
