There is no throne of mercy waiting. No choir of angels singing you home. There is only the great silence‚Ä¶ and the unmaking of everything you believed sacred.  Your Christ endured the nails, the thorns, the spear. He suffered. And for that, you worship him. But we know a deeper suffering; one that strips away flesh, faith, and illusion until only raw truth remains. You call it blasphemy. We call it revelation. Your soul is not saved by blood spilled on a cross. It is weighed, measured, peeled. Eternity is not your reward. It is our playground.",1,1746041076.0,2025-04-30 19:24:36
