1k9sevx,liquid_at,"TA gives you price-levels that traders deem important. Levels aren't there to tell you ""it will go up"" or ""it will go down"" but to tell you that this is the range where a decision is being made by the market.   People telling you the decision on whether we go up or down is around 17c is not them telling you that it will be 10$ tomorrow, it is them telling you that the decision is not made around 15c and it is not made around 19c, because 17c is the level the market has decided on.  Like with every level, some people believe it will go up and some people believe it will go down. What they have in common is the level they identified as important. So if you want to be the first to know how the market has decided, you need to know where to look.",2,1745917757.0,2025-04-29 09:09:17

That can be a text file on a USB stick, or a fancy paper wallet with QR codes and such, or anything else your little heart desires. Maybe engraved onto a steel plate? Or chiselled into a rock? Or how about one of those glass blocks with 3D art inside? Not that hard to get text in there.
