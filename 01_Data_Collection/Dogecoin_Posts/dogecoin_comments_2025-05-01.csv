1kcbcka,Fulvio55,"Where do you get this ‘can’t use it for anything’ crap?  We’ve used doge for plenty of things over the years. I’ve used it for plenty of things myself.  The fact that not much is currently happening comes down to price and greed. The high price makes it risky to both accept and spend, and greed says hoard it because it’ll be worth more tomorrow. Which of course kills commerce.  It’s the same with gold, BTW. Nobody in his right mind would spend gold when the price has tripled in recent years, and is going ballistic because of the orange imbecile and his crazy ideas. That’s not the fault of gold or of the people who own some. And the same applies to doge.  Oh, and massive adoption is never going to happen.

1kby2lg,nightfly82,Ha ha I honestly don’t know if we will get that low but we are closer to 9 cents rather than 90  Me personally I think doge will hit around 25 cents may or June time but then come rite back down to the levels we at now. Summertime is always slow for crypto  Fall tho we will see if there’s one final push in this so called “bull market” 4 year cycle  A doge coin catalyst on its own could help as well,2,1746112461.0,2025-05-01 15:14:21
