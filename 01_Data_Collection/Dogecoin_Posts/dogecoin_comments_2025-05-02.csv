1kdair9,WabanakiWarrior,"Just so cooked. No the US didn't include dogecoin in the strategic reserve. Because it doesn't have any actual utility. That 10 mill was bought by a private buyer. The only way anyone can make money off this coin is by riding the hype train and getting little yoohoos like you to buy thinking the coin is going to explode, then use your little investment as their exit liquidity. Which is why the whales are trying to hype so hard and spread random bs. Good luck though man. You might make some money. Grab that profit while you can.

1kcuwgr,Fulvio55,"#This is an amazingly bad idea!  Take it from someone who lent 11 Bitcoins and never saw them again.  And a similar thing happened with the nearly 1 billion doge in our original tipbot, which were ‘borrowed’ just before a price spike made it impossible to replace them.  Sorry, but it’s exceptionally risky to borrow or lend crypto in any way, shape or form.

1kcuwgr,liquid_at,"I don't think OP is talking about borrowing or lending, but a lombard loan, where you get money by offering a collateral in form of stocks or crypto.   Still a bad idea, since any volatile move in value to the downside would immediately risk a margin call, but still different from borrowing or lending. Much like pawning your stuff for a short term liquidity boost, the main risk is not being able to repay the loan.   Especially if there is a big drop before a run, that drop could create liquidity issues that cause a margin call, just to see the price shoot up when the coins are already taken by the lender.",1,1746261854.0,2025-05-03 08:44:14

1kcuwgr,liquid_at,"Lombard loan is not really ""lending your crypto"". you still own it. You just post it as collateral for your loan. Much like your house with a mortgage.   Like all loans, they only make sense if you use them wisely and increase the money, but when you do that, it can make sense to use your crypto holdings to improve your liquidity.   Not the best way. Not recommended for everyone, but still important to understand the difference.  If you lend out your crypto, someone else is working with your crypto and if they fail, you lose. If you take a lombard loan, you are working with the money you got for your collateral and only your own failure makes you lose your crypto.",1,1746339914.0,2025-05-04 06:25:14

But too many people think about growth as if it were linear. That completely ignores how compounding actually works.
