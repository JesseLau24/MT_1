1kfhqph,liquid_at,"ETF doesn't do much. How many people really do buy an ETF when they can also buy crypto directly?  The sad reality is that crypto can only be shorted if you find a real lender that gives you real coins that you can sell in the market, while an ETF can easily be shorted without owning even a single share of that ETF.   So if the ETF holds 100m Dogecoin, firms can dump the price by selling 100m dogecoin that they don't even know, simply by shorting the ETF in the criminal TradFi system that Crypto was designed to replace.",3,1746472230.0,2025-05-05 19:10:30

1kfhqph,liquid_at,"""whales"" will not buy ETFs. They just want retail to buy ETFs because ETFs can be shorted.

1kfhqph,liquid_at,"of course it will.. How would wall street use liquidity of the ETF to dump the price if they didn't hype it up for retail first?  The part you do not realize is that they can just borrow 10 or 100 times the total amount of Doge the ETF is holding, at fractions of a cent...   If 1m people buy $1000 worth of dogecoin, that's 1 billion in the ETF and it likely won't cost hedgefunds more than a few million to force the ETF to dump a billion of doge onto the market in their next rebalancing.   The coins held in an ETF are not safe there. They are free offers to big corporations to take as they please. They can manipulate the market using those coins, whether the actual owners of those coins like it or not.   Wall street is corrupt.",1,1746604879.0,2025-05-07 08:01:19

1kf0st9,Fulvio55,"First of all, there are no ‚Äògas‚Äô fees. Doge is NOT a token. It has its own blockchain.  Transaction fees are 0.001 Doge per thousand bytes. Which is about six UTXOs (inputs). If you do your own transactions using coinb.in (do use a local copy so you can sign offline and not risk exposing your keys), this is all you need to pay.  However, if you use a client, a much higher fee is likely hardcoded into it. Typically at least 1 Doge.  And if you use a third-party service, they can charge whatever they feel like. Some exchanges have been known to charge as much as 50 Doge. So check the fees before you sign up.",1,1746415635.0,2025-05-05 03:27:15
