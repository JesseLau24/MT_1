1kh7boa,FinalHeaven88,"I mean if I were Powell I would tell Trump straight up if he wants rates to go down he needs to lay down some rate reducing policies. The fact that he's doing the opposite of that is the reason rates aren't dropping. That's really all there is to it, they're holding rates steady to see if things are gonna get messy, and so far it kind of is, as a result of policies he's enacted in the last few months.  Eventually Trump's gonna have to budge on this one, or else we're stuck. Powell already said they don't have to do what he says just cuz he says it, he's holding Trump accountable, and honestly - good for him.",6,1746649578.0,2025-05-07 20:26:18

Its idiocy on scales that should lead to impeachment due to incompetency, but as we are talking about the US failed state its not going to happen.  So the best thing the federal reserve can do for now is to make no announcements nor changes.  Its not just about the american domestic market, its the whole global economy. So americans SHOULD expect HIGHER prices. But this does not mean lower interest rates as the rest of the economy is growing despite the US is shrinking.",1,1746652909.0,2025-05-07 21:21:49

1kgz8h6,ConcreteCrackFiller,"looking closer at that timeline at the bottom it looks like that pump happened right around mid november. so something big must've happened just before then to drive the price up. like really big. probably the election of a president or something. that kind of news would probably have caused more than a few stocks to start climbing rapidly. that president was probably also a big fan of cryptocurrencies which probably would have made cheap crypto look extremely attractive causing a lot of people to start buying in bulk hoping to cash in on the next bitcoin....   anyway, let's shift things in a different direction. let's assume the post is right. let's assume there is a pattern playing out here. the last falling wedge looks like it ran from mid-june into september, with the pump starting around mid to late october.   so if, IF   # IF            this happens the pump likely wont occur for probably another couple months. so not tomorrow. just wanted to get that out there before a bunch of tweakers come in here flooding the sub with ""WhY nO pUmP!?
