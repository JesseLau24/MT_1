1jb9pt0,phi_curious,"love the summaries, i feel like it is getting better with the summaries, even though Lornikos feet not being mentioned is a big dissapointment lol (I understand why though with the token limit you mentioned)",5,1741974686.0,2025-03-14 17:51:26
1jb9pt0,UrbanPKMonkey,I did a count of how many times ‘feet’ was mentioned and it was only 7 times in the last 24H period 😂,3,1741975499.0,2025-03-14 18:04:59
1jb9pt0,phi_curious,That sounds off. Ngl. But obviously depends on the exact time frame. When i search feet manually in TG it’s been mentioned over 30 times yesterday and today.,6,1741975646.0,2025-03-14 18:07:26
1jb9pt0,UrbanPKMonkey,"I thought it was off too. I need to double check that, and it may be because I am discounting memes and images.",3,1741975733.0,2025-03-14 18:08:53
1jb9pt0,phi_curious,"in the end it doesnt really matter, it would just be funny because of lornikos reaction and I could rub his feet under his nose for a while haha",4,1741977507.0,2025-03-14 18:38:27

1jb9pt0,phi_curious,"hmm interesting, i guess it make sense whenever the cut off was. We can do better. Even though I dont think there was much talk about ""J33ting"" at all, so probably it is a mix between limitations of chat gpt and when the cut off was.",4,1741977472.0,2025-03-14 18:37:52
1jb9pt0,UrbanPKMonkey,"The problem is getting thorough discussions, and the only way to get that is through replies and reactions metrics.

1jazqsr,TheGDC33,I will definitely not be giving you financial advice though I do believe in our community and Kendu. You have to make this decision yourself even if I do like the way you're thinking!   What I can say is that we are all responsible for making the good moves happen even yourself. We all have a role to play to propel this project forward and spread it far and wide.,25,1741950951.0,2025-03-14 11:15:51
1jazqsr,Honos11,What other alts do you hold?  I love Kendu but as they say you don't actually lose till you sell.  So I wouldn't sell alts that one can reasonably believe will recover at some point.  But that's just me.,20,1741950721.0,2025-03-14 11:12:01
1jazqsr,p0tatemoon,"if you are invested in a lot of alts, you might want to chose those that you really believe in and that have the potential to go back up again  Personally, I would recommend diversifying a bit instead of having all your eggs in one basket  Like the others said, it will be your decision to make",15,1741956134.0,2025-03-14 12:42:14

1jazqsr,insegniah1,"Not that this should in any way make your decision for you or try and encourage it -  But many of us here are 100% in kendu. Myself included.  Thats actually why im so confident on this project too, as so many holders are completely dedicated to kendu. Being 100% in means people give it their all.  Of course you make what decisions are best for you, but what you are suggesting isnt on the realm of “crazy” and is actually what many of us already do :)",6,1742020897.0,2025-03-15 06:41:37

1jan05c,phi_curious,That would be really interesting. And also could be motivational. Don’t know anything about how hard the data processing is. But do you think one could correlate the MC with activity? Because we all feel how the heat turns up when the charts get a bit of green. Would be cool to see.,8,1741908586.0,2025-03-13 23:29:46

All signs point to a speedy recovery. The ones who remain loyal to Kendu will figure it out. Im going to buy back in eventually once my gains are reached via the coin Im currently in.

It’s a combination of factors why that is the case: we had one bigger whale selling for a few months and this whale slowed down (and afaik sold most he was holding originally), so less sell pressure. Also, some events may create new buy pressure, ie we have a big event coming up in Miami and that will probably bring in people already (connections that are made during organization, radio advertisements for the event, etc.",52,1742848829.0,2025-03-24 20:40:29

It is the relentless work and effort of the Kendu community that has caused buying pressure to overtake selling by $70k on the weekly volume.

Moontube is fully funded by the Moontube Team and developed outside the scope of Kendu entirely. No funds, no supply of Kendu.  Moontube also purchased 10K USD worth of KENDU with their own funds (Price at time of purchase) as a launch prize, which is still up for grabs when the platform launches.

Kendu's native token is built on Ethereum but we are wormholed to Solana and Base too so we have 3 different contract addresses and you'll just need to keep that in mind when purchasing depending on what chain you want to use.   here are the contract addresses for each chain:   ETH: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18  SOL: 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45  BASE: 0xef73611F98DA6E57e0776317957af61B59E09Ed7  it is also recommended to verify contract addresses through official channels like our telegram or verified X account.  edit: also do not reply to dms about this post because 99.9% of the time it is someone trying to scam you.,1,1743981883.0,2025-04-06 23:24:43

1jrjj94,phi_curious,"Imho speaking on spaces is one of the best ways to make meaningful connections on X and to promote Kendu. It also puts you in a different mindset because you have to be more clear with your thoughts: what is kendu? What makes it so special? Why should you join the community?  Naturally not everybody feels comfortable with speaking publicly. But this is something everybody can learn and get comfortable with. Take it step by step. Talk in a VC in the TG or one of our unrecorded spaces. Next start in one of our recorded spaces, or the Kendu community space. Then branch out to some of the more relaxed and smaller spaces on X that are not Kendu related, e.g. Troll King Kendu (a proper Kendu chad) hosts regular spaces where you can talk about anything.   Right now is a perfect time to get started with this. The market has slowed down, spaces are less packed and busy. So this is perfect to learn before the craziness of the storm and to make lasting connections. And beyond helping Kendu, it also will help you as a person.  Maybe we can organize a space where we just talk about that. How to speak on spaces?",13,1743793184.0,2025-04-04 18:59:44

1jqq00f,Hot-Raspberry2758,"Thanks for the amazing writeup Chad! It's helpful and encouraging to see how the community steps up with their own unique skillsets to build kendu into a multifaceted platform. Imagine if kendu would have launched to -10b a year ago. It would just be like another memecoin with no real community support to propel it further. The community is actively preparing the framework for not just another coin. It's THE COIN. We are building the next generation of crypto community platforms. We are integrating crypto into all faucets of life. Would our determination and drive be at the level it is now if we had just been given listing's from top exchanges? I'm not sure. It's because we got to work for kendu as a community, thats the reason we will propel into the billions and beyond.

Or you understand our ethos, like it, understand it, participate or simply believe in it. Or you just go somewhere else.  It's was the previous Dev who was selling dreams with all the ""SHib connection"" and ""secrets things that will come"".  This isn't our approach at all!

1j2iwba,phi_curious,"Great question, I didnt even think so far.  Only option I see for reddit are profile pics. Because user names that show up in the posts are not editable.  We also would have to agree on something that we all can do, like the fox and helmet on X. So either an orange background that slaps, or adding a helmet like this one.     EDIT: or if we can make a customizable reddit avatar that is free to use. Anyone knows if we have done something like that? I dont like it as much, because there is just something special about seeing your current pic in a new version. Just sharing ideas.  https://preview.redd.it/liv4f64rehme1.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16015559174b4f8c0dc505e0719e61874c39d006",18,1741010772.0,2025-03-03 14:06:12

Pepe will probably do good but you probably won't see as much growth in terms of percentage increase.    but im also always wary of the ""trying to recoup your loses by selling at lows game"", because i used to always fail at it 😆.  if you're down 50% already on pepe, it might not be the worst to try and at least wait till it gets back to your original investment before you take it out.    i would say it's up to you ultimately but if you know Kendu then you know the potential.  good luck on your decision 🫵🦊",25,1744470053.0,2025-04-12 15:00:53

1jwxdp9,phi_curious,"Hi L3nni8, thanks for the proactive post. I like that you open the conversation.   Also wanna give a shout out to u/CoopVelociraptor who brought this up in the TG and who will have good input.  Sorry for the unstructured post. These are just my random thoughts:  From my point of view we need to add more content that is not just a random ""smash this"" or ""smash that"", we need content that is funny, that opens a conversation, content that is different and thoughtful.  If we make content that is fun and engaging people naturally come back, because they want to hang out here, and that will also increase our ""smash"" effort.   I have been thinking on how I can contribute, maybe people can give some input on these:  1. post more memes [https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu\_Ecosystem/comments/1jw2rp7/happy\_thursday\_chads\_chadettes](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/comments/1jw2rp7/happy_thursday_chads_chadettes)  2. write articles that are thought provoking [https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu\_Ecosystem/comments/1jvy5zk/did\_you\_read\_the\_snack\_machine\_post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/comments/1jvy5zk/did_you_read_the_snack_machine_post)  3. make a GM post that sets the mood for the day, e.g. a fortune cookie wisdom of the day, or a window of the day. I like the 24h recaps because they are important to create a tight bond between community members, and I think that a similar format that is focused on how to move forward could be interesting. I am not sure yet though what that would exactly be.  In the end though, whatever kind of content each individual creates, it has to be fun to the creator. It should never feel like a task that you have to do, but rather something that you enjoy.",15,1744398399.0,2025-04-11 19:06:39
1jwxdp9,CoopVelociraptor,"Agreed! More actual content, and it’s cool that we’re thinking about it but tbh we could ez start with what we already blast on X.  Maybe just to tidy things up we could pin a “Daily Raid Post” where everyone throws that stuff in there. Might actually even make it easier for folks to find and respond to all of them haha.",4,1744406425.0,2025-04-11 21:20:25
1jwxdp9,phi_curious,"Yo Coop, what’s up? Thanks for the input.  That is a good idea, I guess we could make a pinned post where we post the raid targets, just need to be smart about how we do it otherwise old threads are getting raided lol  As for X content, can you elaborate more? I agree that some of our content on X suits well on here, eg the kojak articles, you video game teasers…what else though?

I don't know because I have rose colored glasses on and I just love Kendu but I wonder if people view us in the same way as I view that coin.

We are stuck again in a range of holder up and down up and down (market PR baby the real challenge and we just need to keep going) I guess I think more purposeful to invite people in is my addition to this convo (yes very late I know, but here I am doing what I can when I can).

1jwxdp9,phi_curious,Thanks for sharing your thoughts. I think our perspectives align quite closely.  You are definitely correct that markets matter and currently not as many people are looking at crypto or investing as much time. On the other hand that also means that this is a good time to build some new strategies and content.

The more unique ways of sharing KENDU the better. I remember a chad came up with beer coasters with the logo and QR code on them. Every bar he visited he left the coasters. I created and printed 500 stickers with the logo, CA's, our motto, our socials, the name ""Kendu Inu"", join the pack phrase and a QR code. I like to travel, so I keep a stack of stickers with me wherever I go. Just have fun with it and enjoy the comradery at KENDU!

It’s a relief to wake up everyday and not be in fear that the dev has done something to harm the project again. Seeing people regain their enthusiasm and faith is contagious and the amount of things being built is unparalleled.  A lot of successful projects have been through difficult times. Kendu has too much going on and too many people that love it to not be successful on a long enough timeline.   The fallout from Libra, Melania etc has opened a lot of eyes about how stacked the deck is against the average person chasing new launches. Conviction plays that are constantly building and growing are the only way for 99.9% of people to make money and I’m confident Kendu will capture a lot of the mindshare when market sentiment flips.",21,1739834753.0,2025-02-17 23:25:53

1iriupm,p0tatemoon,"It might not directly answer your question but I believe the strategy lies withing the community  You can have the best strategy to spread out the words about a project but without a community to take action, it will be difficult    Kendu strong point is how the community members all work together but also on their own. If someone like to play games, they can ad a Kendu tag to their name and that counts as work. We try to have real interaction/conversation whenever is possible   All those little work counts and adds up quickly  *We don't gamble, we work* that's the mentality when we decide to invest in Kendu. It's not like any other stock where we just put money and wait to see things go well for the company. We want to put a bit of our own effort. If Kendu succeed, it won't be because of one person but because of all of us",17,1739798687.0,2025-02-17 13:24:47

We already have pretty good engagement, on par or higher than pepe, wif, brett if you go by certik. And also here the community always does something:  * we have been really active on the billboard on base to make kendu art which has earned us a few shouts by the dev * we organize spaces on x regularly to talk about kendu and bring new people in * and we raid pretty much anyone we want, whether it’s a poll against UFD, PI and SPX, or to get a free article by clarissa yorke - our community shows up organically.

Please remember the rules here, we do not put ""Kendu"" and ""scam"" in the same sentence regardless of what your perceptions of the past are.  There are currently no plans for the Chads NFTs.

We need to get in position for the moment the market sentiment turns positive. KENDU needs to be on everybody's mind.

The “amazing” is the community  The developments and news / alpha we pump out consistently as a community is just incredible.  Recently: - certik audit rated us in top 5% with a mark higher then pepe in community - sponsoring a miami event that will have thousands and thousands of attendees. Sponsored with our energy drinks, merch, you name it - game being developed by a team and another hame that will end up on steam - comarketing from wormhole soon - base bridge and sol bridge - 50k otc to help with base - new website incoming - community members attending IRL crypto events to network for kendu - one person even going to an OKX event in dubai - growing every day during a market this bad - clarissa article to be released - free coindcx listing - and infinite much more.

I don't know exactly, but my guess is around disbelief after a run up following the depression phase. Maybe I'm right or maybe I'm wrong.  But I'm sure we're not even close to thrill and euphoria. When your barber tells you to buy Kendu, then you know we're close to the top. I'm buying KENDU since June '24 and I'm down like most of us. But I know what our goals are. And I see the signs: Activity, positivity, Certik audit, irl products, etc. Nothing to worry about. I just take advantage of those prizes.  I'm just a normal chad, but I was right buying BTC @$16k, SOL @$17, WIF @$0.12 and Moons @$0.08. I swapped all of it to KENDU. That's my strongest conviction ever.

1iqisrg,Liminal_Dogess,"A suggestion for how to attach them, you could possibly carefully sew a safety pin on the back to create a badge. 🙂   Edit: another idea is to sew a key chain to the back and then for security, stitch a sturdy fabric to the back to offer more security. If you have two patches, depending on symmetrical shape, you could stitch a separate patch onto the rear to keep the key chain in place. That way, you are always showing the logo regardless of the position of the keyring. You can buy loads of cheap keyring/key chains from eBay.

The chart also tells a story of our history, one with the Dev who we actively wrestled with as a community. The best way to view it now is after the CTO in where KOLs and influencers have returned, we have had a massive engagement and activity spike and all the OGs have returned.  We also have just formed a higher low.   The chart is bottomed out, alt season around the corner, with us now building very steadily and we have no hindrance anymore in regards to a dev.market just had a huge capitulation and leverage flush and we were chilling.

1ii7ajz,Potlimitcrypto,"The chart looks bad, granted. So too do most memecoin charts at the moment. Attached are Binance-listed projects in 2025 and their declines since listing. Everything has been decimated, and safe to say, Kendu with them for reasons of our own some of which can be attributed to the ex-dev selling and launching other tokens.  The metrics outside of chart/PA are in a state of growth. Community activity, sentiment, and drive is up only with the recent change and work will compound when there is more liquidity in the market to tap into.  We're not going to stop pushing Kendu, Kendu isn't going anywhere, and our output exceeds that of multi-billion dollar projects. There is only one way I can see Kendu going this cycle and that is very far upwards from where it is now.  So, you can buy when there's blood in the streets, or buy at higher prices. But outside of the chart that much of the market shares, other metrics are looking insanely good, and price catches up with those eventually.  In a pinned message in this sub you can listen to my recent interview with crypto Rich about Kendu's path to growth at scale.

1ih3fl3,kingkongbananakong,Because we’re next up. Saying we’re dead is like saying we already had a run but we have never had a run. The big spike you see on the left of the chart was done in a few days with 0 community and made look way bigger than it was due to 1 order from someone with the wrong settings for his spread.   This is what all charts of major breakout coins like the big meme coins looked like before breakout.   So people start looking for the next meme coin that will break out this cycle and for that you can’t look at price because all major project had big downward trends before breaking out. What happens behind the scenes in those downward trends is key here. As many coins as possible need to get distributed to real believers.  Me and many other holders know that Kendu can rise to 10-20b like the other coins easily. If many holders have that same conviction eventually it will turn out true. Because the people holding the token get to decide when to sell it.   If you bought earlier into Kendu way more people had lower sell targets thus was it way harder to climb the charts.   https://www.armchairbanker.com/will-kendu-inu-increase-1447-and-other-memecoins-to-explode-in-2025/,2,1738751825.0,2025-02-05 10:37:05

The founder did it for fun and as a joke yet was not aware it would go high and he sold early.  He regrets selling early.  The community brought it up.  Yes Elon Musk played a huge part of it because he helped it pumped up multiple times.  The community stayed strong.  Just like Shiba.  Kendu Inu is undervalued and one day it will just explode.  The community is active and the word just keeps spreading.  As long as there’s new holders everyday and eventually it will break through and go back up.  Then another one.  It’s under valued and should be over $3-5 Billion and no higher than $10 Billion on bad market.  Yet a lot of room to grow.,2,1739908660.0,2025-02-18 19:57:40

Focus on what is in your reach, on the things you can impact, the things you can change.  As one piece of advice, instead of shilling Kendu 24/7 online, go outside and take walk. Maybe print some kendu flyers that you can hand out and distribute IRL. Or go for a crypto/web3 event in your city. Plenty to find on eventbrite or meetup.

1iok0su,phi_curious,"Good question. First of all, I do agree that Kendu is for everyone and that the demographic is mixed (age, background, country etc), but there is probably still a bias towards the general crypto crowd: male, younger age, etc.  As for my approach, for placing them in random spots, I went to areas that are highly frequented and placed them somewhere where they will be touched and found by someone guaranteed, eg the credit card terminal on the last pic, or the phone holder in the second pic.  Let’s see how things go. Maybe one day when we asked a newcomer how they found us, they will send a picture of one of these cards.

Kendu really does stand alone and is so consistent with the output and positive sentiment no matter what.  that's an obvious sign to me that the long term is valued highly in the Kendu community 🔥,3,1741647276.0,2025-03-10 22:54:36

I put all my money in $Kendu over a period of time starting last May. This was an opportunity that I couldn’t afford to miss. The risk vs reward was too high. Do I sometimes have doubts? Of course, we all do. However, that feeling of when it’s green is more powerful. We are inevitable. Even back to ATH is a 25x and with what we have built and continuing to build giving up now would be more than stupid. They always say very few people stay on the ride to the top which is true.

1j5fl7c,phi_curious,Pls vote on lewk. It is as fast as writing a one word Reddit reply and sends you a daily reminder.  Showing presence on all platforms is about sending a message. Let’s please not talk ourselves out of something like that.,6,1741334187.0,2025-03-07 07:56:27

Kendu is stronger than ever and I have no doubt that we will make some really positive moves when the market actually turns with a positive sentiment and an injection of liquidity into more risky assets. Maybe even some QE and whatever else can turn this ship around for good.

1j41lg8,TheGDC33,I can see your comments and tell you would be considered a troll by many. I would argue you are just uninformed on the cycles and the movement of Memecoins. You came for massive gains but weren't informed (research and reading) enough to understand you will also have to likely suffer massive drawdowns. That part is on you. This is a painful and crazy game and I am not sure I am having fun with price action but I do love the community and I know the assignment. This is what I signed up for. Don't buy the ticket if you can't handle the ride.  I wish you well in your investing arc. You can always select something way way safer. BTC is a great option if you want crypto or just mutual funds,5,1741194618.0,2025-03-05 17:10:18
1j41lg8,Charming-Hurry6649,"Bullshit - in the end, all these stories are there to keep the people in holding the coin instead of cutting losses. they are used as exit liquidity… there wont be any value of kendu and probably in the next ,bull‘ run some other, newer and frsher coins will do it.",1,1741256894.0,2025-03-06 10:28:14
1j41lg8,TheGDC33,"I stand by my comment. This is how memecoins move and crypto is extremely volatile overall. Look up the price action of SHIB from last cycle or even how Pepe started...same thing, just massive draw downs. That doesn't mean it happens with every coin because the market is saturated with garbage. But it is fact and it isn't just lightning striking.  https://preview.redd.it/4eqfomzx32ne1.jpeg?width=1050&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a04d9f89ba9ef4892e88c72b9a5599c77cc1e58f  Better if you find the PEPE chart yourself.

If a person doesn't see the value then it is ok the leave Kendu on the side and continue to search for another investment   As I always say, memecoins are a high risk high reward investment. DYOR is mandatory.

Only thing really keeping us from really moving up is a few whales who are exiting to go chase buttpooper coin or think meme coins are done.

1i6k229,lemond4455,"Thanks for pinging me. Your suspicion is correct in that building something like the Chads marketplace, *in a form that is actually competitive*, is a herculean task. Given this, and all the things about Miazaki that has recently come to light, like his unwillingness to follow through on even paying the winners of meme competitions, my current thinking is that it's highly unlikely that any significant work has gone into the marketplace and it's not just a matter of ""waiting for the right market conditions to release"", like he claims.   What he's actually planning to do with the Chads marketplace going forward is anyone's guess, but obviously his wider pattern is not reassuring. The one silver-lining is that the standard of NFTs that were used (ERC-721) opens the door for the development a different Chads marketplace without any major technical hurdles in implementing the sort of revenue-sharing for NFT holders that he had initially outlined.       I would be certainly be open to the possibly of helping develop such a marketplace, but I think right now the dust hasn't even settled for all the events that have occurred in the last week (Miazaki is trying to force himself back into the project?) so it would be too early to say.",7,1737495748.0,2025-01-21 21:42:28

1ixezyz,p0tatemoon,"to be honest, I see it like a workout. I make a daily/weekly plan and I follow through. I can miss a day put I try not to miss 2 days in a row  For example, an easy one would be a morning routine :  Designated 10-15min morning routine to Kendu while having my coffee   * Upvote : Kendu on coingecko, coinmarketcap, certik, lewk, etc... * Check new post/repost on X by main account : like and leave a comment * Check kendu reddit : like all post and comments, leave comments  Then you can add extra stuffs like going on TG, smash all pin post, search for $KENDU on X and smash, print business card/ stickers and leave them around town, shilling in real life, etc...be creative!  I would recommend going super easy, just 5min a day but everyday. Consistency is key and the hardest hurdle  Like working out, I don't really rely on motivation. I just do it. If you need a goal, try to do it for the whole year because that's when we are expecting the crypto bull cycle to run.

You can give anything you want : no work at all, 5sec, 5 min, 5 hours, etc  To be honest with you, I was invested in Kendu for a couple of months but did zero work. When I saw the CTO happening and saw how the community got together, I wanted to be part of what makes Kendu so special : ""We don't gamble, we work"". I started with upvotes here and there.

1juiy0i,Potlimitcrypto,"Well, to everyone it's something different but to me is a giant permissionless brand umbrella that extends from onchain into real world businesses and products. There is nothing that can't be built with Kendu. There is no avenue that can't be explored under the Kendu umbrella. The goal is to be everywhere all the time and culturally endlessly support the project's growth via voluntary donations/kickbacks from the businesses launching under the umbrella in various ways.   The new website goes into it in a bit more detail, Kendu.io.  Join the Telegram and scope it out for a while. 🙂",9,1744144001.0,2025-04-08 20:26:41
1juiy0i,phi_curious,"It sounds like your ETH is on base, correct? If yes you need to select the base CA for Kendu  and make sure to swap your ETH on base. Be careful to use the correct CA, do not search by name.  The CA for Kendu you can either find on the kenduinu X profile in the linked kendu carrd. Or in the TG. Or on CMC under contracts at the bottom of the page (if on phone).  https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu   Does this help? If not let me know.",7,1744132937.0,2025-04-08 17:22:17

1juiy0i,phi_curious,"Edit: check my other comment.  The CA is the contract address, so you got the term correct :)  However the address you are using is when you want to swap Kendu on the Ethereum chain, not on base.  This is the CA for Kendu on base: 0xef73611f98da6e57e0776317957af61b59e09ed7  You should verify this through one of the platforms I have stated above. Always verify and double check, do not trust information given by others blindly.  Then check if the swap works. If not I can help again, I haven’t swapped on base in a while and usually have done it directly in phantom wallet. So need to think lol",4,1744133731.0,2025-04-08 17:35:31

1juc5up,SpeakerClassic4418,"The main TG is the TG.  It's for all purposes and having fun.  With its fast paced nature it's great for raiding on X when time is of the essence.    Kendu army barracks has no talking, it's more of a simple pinned format of major reddit posts, polls we want to win and any big news, stayseaarts newest, upcoming festival is a great current example.    It is not meant to be used instead of the Main TG, but to compliment it.  You can log into kendu army barracks 1-2 times a day, like the posts and comments to it, and comment yourself.  Vote in a poll, etc.  Most days will only have 2-4 actual actions to take.  Another example I want to get in there is the stocktwits initiative.    Join up and check it out.  If you hold kendu, remember, you're working for your own bag and I just want to make it a little easier to get more done for more of us!

I entered the old TG a few months ago planning to “save” the community that I knew was still below the surface. I couldn’t believe the comments still backing miazaki despite the performance of the coin.   I felt that the community were sheep waiting to be fed on more by the wolf. I should have respected everyone’s perspective independent of my own. I was muted rather quickly as Kevin F. told me to just stop. He didn’t tell me I was out of line or that I was being aggressive. Just stop. I should have. I should have had more faith in all of you. I’m sure we’ve lost some for good but that’s ok.   Onward and upward my friends.

To me self-reflection is such an important part of the process of implementing a larger change (whether in personal life, professional, etc).

1i77usl,Potlimitcrypto,"Roadmaps are the death of memecoins, they only exist to create sell the news events. There will never be a Kendu roadmap, everyone will be working autonomously on hundreds of things all the time. However, I am writing a whitepaper of sorts that will go into vision of the future/culture for growth and success/opportunity of Kendu.  The team are the Loyalists, most of whom have worked tirelessly on the project for six months or more. The team is also you, the community, and your continuous efforts. The change we needed was Miazaki leaving, if you've had your ear to the ground you would have witnessed the complete insanity that led to a lack of faith/selloff in the project.  I have ran projects and built communities, my role has been business development and community management, in fact, some of the active mods we have like Mike (Kendu Energy) and Kojak (Community updates) have followed me from a previous project. I've raised VC capital in the harshest of market conditions and negotiated significant deals. I've been headhunted by large Arrington Capital-backed Polkadot ecosystem projects and my work has been noticed by people at Yearn Finance and Sushi swap.   There are no skeletons in my closet and I've never launched a memecoin. While I've never single-handedly taken a project to multi-billions from nothing, we must remember too that before Shib, Shytoshi was just a holder begging for a toadswap airdrop, and I believe I'm coming from a far better position than that with much more experience under my belt.   I have proven myself over the last 11 months, and how much I care about the community. I've showed up every single day without a single day off... But most importantly, I'm a good person who cares about the lives of people around him.   Now that I'm in the driver's seat you can rest assured that there will be no other token launches, drunken hateful speeches, bad product launches, egregious dumping on the chart, blatant incompetency, and so on that will harm and scare away investment.  My vision for Kendu will be available in the whitepaper.",60,1737545348.0,2025-01-22 11:29:08

I’ll be honest I had pretty much written off this project as another meme coin that went to zero, and I say that holding what I think is a substantial amount of Kendu.  You have changed that.  The crazy energy of the community is what got me  to buy Kendu and I really hope you and your team can re-kindle that fire. While nobody can guarantee anything or predict the future, I feel that the intentions at the top align with the community. The rest is hard work.",31,1737549316.0,2025-01-22 12:35:16

While at KM all the alarm signals were red right from the start (I’ve been there since around July), for you and this community everything now lights up in a bright, bright green. In the last few weeks the situation has become more and more complicated and my concerns about it have become greater and greater. But now after this turnaround brought about by this great community, I am completely calm and full of excited anticipation for everything that may come next! I thank you for your way of communicating things openly, fairly, calmly and clearly and yet always with a dose of humor. It is exactly what it needs internally and externally. clear words that are followed by clear actions. Just reliability.  I’m no longer worried that with Kendu we’ll write the story we’ve always dreamed of.  However, we still have a bumpy road ahead of us and I know that you are a good guy, so I would like to say that in everything you do for the community and the project, take good care of yourself too!  with best wishes, we run it up !",17,1737556339.0,2025-01-22 14:32:19

They have tried gamifying it and different approaches, but the truth is it's cumbersome and boring. Kendu needs to be agile and nimble, we need to be able to act fast. Everyone can be considered their own DAO and free to lead Kendu in the direction they want to see it go in, without governance required.

It’s not an indictment on the Kendu community, but if I eg. Pushed out something with adroll or micro transaction mechanics that fed revenue directly into the community wallet (and/or Chad nft holders) I’ve got no doubt y’all would love that but the normies would come for me for being yet another game dev that built this type of game.

1i78igi,phi_curious,"I don’t think there has been a decision yet how the situation is going to be handled. Some people suggest a refund with what is left from that wallet (even though a lot has already been sold by KM), others talked about a CTO for the chads, or to hope that they will become valuable as NFTs once the MC of Kendu explodes (as part of interesting lore).",8,1737572017.0,2025-01-22 18:53:37
1i78igi,Therzie,Turns out that was just a cheap scam by Miazaki to load up his Kendu bag. Decision has been made to not continue with it and focus on getting Kendu Inu to billions and beyond.

I tuned into two really valuable spaces where Miazaki had important guests on (other big crypto influencers) and both of them were a shit show.  One of them he was obviously drunk which is just crazy.   But most importantly he just genuinely sucks at Public speaking. He dodges important questions and brushes it off as trying to “fend of the jeets”.   He often has no plan on what to say and many times it was just straight up painful to listen to him answer questions. It sounded as if a middle schooler was taking a Public speaking class for the first time. Just straight gibberish.  I can go on about how he failed marketing and supporting this coin. He really had something good going on and half assed it. I’m glad I got out awhile ago, but I really do feel bad for those that blindly still follow him.",5,1737416655.0,2025-01-20 23:44:15

1i5soxa,ResonanceCascade1998,"Legit the only reason it got this low is because of Miazaki's decisions. I'd like to put some blame on the community too for putting him up on a pedestal and making it that type of cult. From the very beginning he said the project wasn't meant to be dependent on him. That doesn't excuse his decisions knowing people put him on that pedestal but I think it puts things into a better perspective. Not to mention I've had some pretty shady stuff leaked to me about some of the team and Miazaki. From what I can tell the community was absolutely farmed and that needs to be known going forward.   Is recovery possible? I don't see why not, to this day very few if any communities compare to what Kendu had and still has. If the community can come together with some new leads I think the sky is the limit really. I've said this before but Miazaki was definitely right saying Kendu was a master class in marketing. I've seen Kendu inspired tokens reach millions. If those are just inspired tokens without direct connection imagine the potential this community still has.   I can't stand the guy but providing a platform for him to get better and do better might really open a lot of eyes. I've seen people come back from far worse than where Miazaki is at now. The trust won't be there for me but I would love to see a ""redemption arc"" for the guy. This would also work to Miazaki's favor. I want to make it clear this next bit is NOT a threat but stuff I've witnessed floating around. Miazaki has enemies and as much as I don't like him I don't want to see anyone's life in danger or etc. Coming back purely as a community member to help pump the project in good faith would look great on his end. This was about the community from the start anyways. I haven't talked directly to Miazaki since before the summer so if someone could forward this to him that'd be super rad.   Tldr:I am absolutely a Miazaki hater but the catch is I don't really don't hate anyone on this planet and want to see everyone doing better. If this CTO makes it to ATH and everyone is happy that'd again, be super rad and say loads about the community itself.

1i5b231,PrestigiousAd9825,The gap between potential and reality is only as wide as your perspective is narrow - we’ve got WAY too much of a head start on this idea to not be able to attract the best and brightest ppl to join us and really build this thing,16,1737342041.0,2025-01-20 03:00:41
1i5b231,PrestigiousAd9825,"**OBJECTIVE 3: MAKE FOMO OUR FUEL**  *Strategy 3a: Commit to mass appeal/adoption*  We used to be SO, SO good about creating an environment that could appeal to anybody who got involved. I know several people personally who I was soft-launching Kendu to when we were near ATH who wouldn't touch Kendu with a 20-foot pole today: not because of the price or the leadership struggles, but because they'd dip out the second they saw a meme that got too political or unfocused to make us look serious and not like some niche bro-coin that could be rugged at any moment. We've GOT to get back there to ignite the rocket.  As we redevelop a community ethos and think of ways to make Kendu look appealing to the next generation of chads who will help us grow further, we have to reinforce the idea that the group will inevitably take the shape of what we make it to be. If there's any kind of content, political or otherwise, that alienates people into thinking they won't get a piece of the pie or credit for what they contribute, that kind of unwelcoming energy creates a poison that artificially limits our potential and exposes us to an unfathomable opportunity cost. A proper set of communication guidelines or even just a team that can regularly go outside and control the narrative of what we stand for and what we want to do feels like an easy way to insulate ourselves from this cost.  *Strategy 3b: Use our stats to tell a story*  Right now, we have over 16,000 holders who have each bought into what we're doing. We pumped up the price 10x higher than this with fewer than half that holder count just half a year ago. The potential of what's possible with our philosophy is the best tool in our arsenal to succeed - and if we organize building a formal narrative and series of talking points to explain in plain, simple terms why this potential exists, we have the chance to get that price ratio back.  I don't think there's any harm in speculating about what Kendu could be worth someday, or even what it should be worth if we do everything right from this point forward - but if we can visualize what we've been able to accomplish already using our past as the proof, it opens the right kind of doors to get people to genuinely buy in. No more of this ""trying to get the attention of then beefing with whatever crypto influencer is fading us"" shit - what we're doing should make sense to a new buyer without a third-party opinion from any ""expert"" validating what we're saying. Positive attention is great and negative attention is news, but if the narrative is a return to community control, we have to be able to prove it without having to be at the mercy of external influence to permit our success. ""Attract, don't chase"" and all that jazz.  *Strategy 3c: Get back into the conversation*  Memecoin development isn't a game of speed - it's a game of acceleration. If we build tactics around organizing the community to invest at pre-determined periods of time, we could re-enter the top trending charts on all of those platforms we used to take for granted. Maybe we just have a day where we boost the trade volume like crazy by telling everyone to trade on a few key focus exchanges. Maybe we have a day where everyone buys $5 worth of Kendu at a pre-determined time regardless of what the price is to throw a match into the metaphorical gas tank.  If we build organization and infrastructure that allows us to make big waves, and follow that up with a dedicated team of informed leadership that can make a great impression when we're asked about those waves, it would put us in league with what every billion dollar project has had to have by necessity.  We can believe in 10x, 50x, 100x+ growth all we want... but the people who will inevitably be responsible for finding the chads who will finance that are going to need a good reason why. We cannot afford to put the cart before the horse on this and prioritizing our public relations/optics beyond a comment section raid or like spamming exercise will prove critical to do that.",19,1737326417.0,2025-01-19 22:40:17

1i5b231,PrestigiousAd9825,"**OBJECTIVE 2: NEVER LAND ON OUR BACK HEEL**   *Strategy 2a: Reinforce our floor*   Before we hit ATH, there were several instances where a whale would sell and it would cause a sharp drop in less than an hour (kind of like last night). What would normally be seen as a time to placate holders and stop the bleeding instead became a challenge to get people to double down on their investment - and within hours we would eat the dip so violently it created a butterfly effect where other chads who didn't initially buy in the trough would send more money in to keep the momentum moving and push the price up as quickly as possible. I'd like to recreate that by strategizing how we talk about buying Kendu. The massive benefit we have this time around is exchange access - even if we're still fighting to play with the big boys. If I were to see a chad worrying in the chat about whether it was ""too late"" to profit from a price recovery, I'd give them my honest advice - which is that it doesn't have to be.   Coins that can jump 40%+ in a day look attractive to jeets and uncommitted buyers, but if we start recommending during rallies for people to set aside what they would have thrown into the project and save it for a rainy day by leveraging limit trading, we can recreate this even more efficiently than we have in the past. Prices are cyclical in crypto - burnout from buying high and having to sell low isn't. I legit think we should start directing people who haven't done so already to get onto the exchanges and sink their cash into a grid of buys that makes it harder for those drops to get worse. Even if a whale comes back and tries a flash crash to sell all of their position, I can't imagine it'll be a bad thing when half the chat just boosted their position 20% without having to think or worry about the price because it's already recovered from that low.   This strat also gives us more bandwidth to regulate our growth - people who'd be tempted or may feel guilty taking profit on a 20-40% rally may feel better about doing so if they're not worried it'll be our last green candle. I bet a bunch of them would even do so only to recover a larger position - but they only will if they think Kendu is trending UP. This is critical if we want larger community participation while the new system of leadership takes shape.   *Strategy 2b: Create a plan around our ethos*   A huge part of the community spirit that has dwindled over the last few months is the enthusiasm around the main idea of the project - taking control of your future in crypto by creating a project that is designed to succeed because it's not designed to do anything else. This idea of not hiding behind ""use cases"" like Kendu Chads ""revolutionizing the NFT market"" and making the process of understanding how this project will earn money easy to learn is going to be massive to scale this thing up further.   That's no shade to Chads either - I own three of them myself. I just happen to think they look a lot more valuable to people who see them as a way to ladder up future profit instead of as the sole catalyst that will make us money in the long term. Whether it's Kendu Labs coins, the SOL projects, or anything touching NFTs, it makes our core offering a much tougher sell to new members and will not give people disaffected by crypto a reason to care about the narrative. Does it have to take a back seat? No. But it should at the very least be riding shotgun when we're making a first impression with skeptics and newcomers.   Also - this might be petty, but I'd love to start keeping receipts on negative CoinGecko and CMC comments. Imagine if you were just learning about Kendu and peeped the chart, only to see a comment calling the project ""dead"" followed by a response days later showing a full recovery + some growth with triple the likes on it. Feels like a missed opportunity to organize keeping this negativity in check.   *Strategy 2c: Use transparency to drive focus*   Speaking of which, the haters of this project have also picked up on the lack of transparency we currently have and are trying to beat us over the head with it. It's taken all of our latest accomplishments, like being the first project in the history of the blockchain to vote their way to a free Certik audit, and drowned them out in the noise of skepticism and FUD from complete strangers. We cannot arm these people with the tools to own our public spaces online.   Voting for 5-star ratings on CMC and Lewk is a great start, but there's nothing more valuable to our long-term optics than being able to sit in our truth and own that we truly are what we stand for. I think this means re-committing to the idea of being positive and aspirational - to get even people who think we're all crazy to start rooting for us because they see we're trying to do something, and aren't just playing an elaborate game of follow-the-leader with someone who hasn't delivered on the shots they've called.   People shouldn't care about us because they think they might be able to watch someone staple a sheet of paper to their forehead - they should care because they can understand what we're trying to do and see how collaborative the process of making something great can be. That's what wins us holder count, investment, and a fighting shot at these elusive T1 exchanges.",17,1737326371.0,2025-01-19 22:39:31

1i5b231,PrestigiousAd9825,"Yesterdays infodump thread/more elaborate descriptions of strategy:  **OBJECTIVE 1: BE INEVITABLE**  *Strategy 1a: Get space for Kendu IRL*  I know some folks were surprised to see how much presence coins like $HEGE and $POWSCHE were able to get with a smaller MC than ours, and how flash-in-the-pan projects like $CHILLGUY were able to spring up seemingly overnight - but it made complete sense to me considering those were the only projects I've ever seen in local, public spaces (think stickers on stop signs and the like).  We have something even more powerful with Kendu - a large team of creative minds who know how to build branded products and services. With a little investment and some tactical thinking, we could blow the lid wide open in where people can see, find, and ask about us and what we're up to.  Ex. The NFL's NFC Championship Game is happening next Sunday. Let's say Detroit wins this week and gets to host it at home. Why do we not have a group of Detroit-based chads yet who's job it is to hand out Kendu Energy drinks for free at the tailgate? We could develop a community fund to expense sending the drinks there, pay the chads involved a little bonus for their time/shilling work, and use the photos to promote on social media the way Red Bull has.  *Strategy 1b: Find our tribe where others aren't looking*  The most bullish aspect of this cycle for me has been hearing from people who aren't invested in crypto. I've met people who refuse to buy BTC because they think it's ""destroying the environment"" and others who have only even heard of meme coins because of that Hawk Tuah fiasco.  We need to find people who may not be curious themselves about the crypto space yet, but who are still a little curious about why others have gotten into it so much. The kind of people who feel a sense of FOMO because they weren't in on the in-crowd when $GME exploded and feel a sense of injustice around big money calling the shots with their retirement.  Seeing the massive influx of people leaving TikTok for an even more Chinese-based social media app out of spite against the Supreme Court showed me that this rebel streak is alive and well in everyday people - so if we can get a message out that says ""you don't have to bet your life savings to get enough money to pay for your life savings"", it'll build up our holder count, talent base, and general awareness/hype.  Ex. We should start posting memes in places that naturally attract people who would want to root for Kendu - think forums about getting off the grid, cybersecurity-related SM groups, and anywhere else people are worried they won't be able to pull their money out of their bank someday.  *Strategy 1c: A job for every Chad*  If there's a mistake I think this project has made so far, it's been pausing the development of groups/teams for specialized projects that play to their skillsets. We have artists, creatives, marketers, computer programmers, finance nerds, and PR specialists in this group that would be springing headfirst into the action if they didn't worry they'd be looked at as a control freak or rogue by suggesting anything new. This has to change if we want to take full advantage of the opportunity we have.  We should sit down and define our need state for this type of talent - thinking out any scenario we could need someone from the group to flex their skills on our behalf. Maybe there's a TG chat specifically for legal experts or people connected to them that can help us navigate the regulatory process. Maybe we have another just for writers/press specialists who focus on how we position the project in interviews and media quotes. Another for designers and graphic artists to create specific brand guidelines for how the Kendu brand looks in print and on your computer screen.  It shouldn't just be ""let's get to work"" - every chad should either have a space to collaborate with people of a similar professional background/interest, or at the very least, the freedom to eventually be trusted to build that out with leadership once the skill becomes needed and pressing.",14,1737326122.0,2025-01-19 22:35:22

Feel free to check in the TG with someone to confirm if what I am saying is best for the algorithm.

That was the reference to the ""journey""  Some memecoins have a core value like an utility, making unique memes and some have nothing but the thumbnail on coingecko. Kendu's core value is ""We don't gamble, we work"". People who joined did it because they want to believe in it and do their part. People who don't believe in it just skip the project and continue scrolling  It is because a community member did their part / work that you notice Kendu and left a comment   Even in real life, we can't expect to do nothing and get rich unless we got lucky  I still hope that your investments do well this cycle and that you find the hidden gem that will make you rich",11,1740159807.0,2025-02-21 17:43:27

1istfr9,[deleted],I have hopes for ETH doing well moving forward. I think ETH doing well is a good indicator. It hit that big dip and found its bottom and its been snaking up.   I think some other memecoins that are/were very popular are on their way to slow death.    Kendu.. Kendu will survive and flourish. I really feel this is the gauntlet month and what makes it through this will prove itself in the hottest flames,5,1739964487.0,2025-02-19 11:28:07

1istfr9,p0tatemoon,"This is not a financial advice so take it with a grain of salt   In my opinion, the fact that we are investing in memecoins means that we should be aware of the possible consequences. It is a high risk high reward kind of investment   I invested in Kendu because of the motto ""We don't gamble, we work"", the effort of the community, the fact that it is also been audited + KYC / wormhole / CTO was also a bonus. Those are my criteria for this investment. If Kendu doesn't meet those criteria anymore then I have no reason to hold. For now, it is still going strong for me   I think you should ask yourself if Kendu still checks the things you believed in when you started to invest. It is easy to look at a chart of other coins and say ""If I sold at X, then bought at Y, I could have made a lot of money"".    The question would be : what is my next move? If I decide to sell X coin then I have to write down all the reasons to do so. If that coin goes up afterwards then I have no regret because I had all those arguments to sell.

1istfr9,insegniah1,"Sure nothing is certain but thats where the whole “we dont gamble, we work” stems from  You work to maximise the chances of success  You work to turn the “luck” in to a reward  Maybe we have a nuclear war tomorrow and the market collapses  Assuming though we have the bull, eth hitting ATHs and an alt season like we are meant to ( we will ) then all strong communities in the space will succeed  Personally I have never seen a community like Kendu  It is just simply a matter of when in my mind, not if  In addition, “delusion” contributes to a coins success  If everyone thinks well this is a 20B dollar coin, then it is likely a 20B coin because well no one is selling until then  I myself am a realist in life.

It's not fun but these whales exiting their position at the bottom is better for all of us in the long run. Once the market turns around things will be very different and fewer early whales will mean less suppression when we go up.   But really, the market is ass right now. If you were to jump into anything it would be pure luck if it went up. The beauty of KENDU compared to other coins is that we have a community that sets it apart from everything else.

1istfr9,p0tatemoon,"The ""work it and community stuff"" is the core of Kendu. I can understand that it is not for every type of investors  A bit like some coins that main purpose is having their artist create unique memes. Some people will decide to invest because they believe it will be popular and go viral. If a person doesn't like memes, why would they invest in that coin? Same thing with ""We don't gamble, we work""  As for another rug, Kendu has now been KYC verified so I believe it adds a layer of trust  At the end of the day we all have to keep in mind that memecoins are a high risk high reward investment. I know that I can get wrecked at anytime and I'm ready to face it  We always hear about people who made a lot of money off crypto but we don't often hear about the ones who lost.

1inou12,TheGDC33,First I would say we have very very little volume. Second to answer your question: look at the buys and sells from the three other pictures included. When buy volume is equal to sell volume MC doesn't move. Surely you can this guess what makes MC/price go up or down.   Volume is the total amount of buys and sells,8,1739371962.0,2025-02-12 14:52:42

Gem Hunter is a huge supporter, and Frothless seems to have been converted just to name a few.  While I know it is hard to shill and spread the movement when you aren't feeling the potential that is really what sets us up when the market and in particular memes come back.

1infu9p,kingkongbananakong,To be honest i don’t think the chads platform will launch… it’s a common trope for developers to always have something “ready to launch” to keep buyers engaged. I believe in Kendu inu the token but the NFT was a Geoff venture and although I bought one i don’t think it’s more than a trinket. I also disconnected my wallets from the Kendu chads platform and I advise people to do the same you never know if the old dev will do more to hurt us,7,1739345769.0,2025-02-12 07:36:09

1imwcaw,CoopVelociraptor,"Short answer - Yes.  Go right ahead and check what the greatest runners of last bullrun were priced at this time in 2021. Alt season hasn’t started yet, we’re at the point where Wintermute have crashed something but BTC dominance hasn’t quite settled. It’s a great time to stack, but if you can’t stack the next best thing you can do is hodl and enjoy the ride.  Nobody has seen the kind of IRL presence Kendu has and continues to build, in crypto. The holder count goes up exponentially on the daily and we’re about to launch a website that makes it so much easier for the normies to get in. Then on-chain we’ve got a Certik grade of A with KYC verification. Not to mention, whatever chads &amp; chadettes decide they’re gonna do next from here - the thing carrying this project was and will always be us.

1imwcaw,[deleted],"Timing coincides with other peak times, but if you know about crypto, you know it cant be predicted.   I wouldnt be surprised if BTC dominance never drops and the 'alt season' never comes to fruition. This isnt fud, its just telling you not to expect anything just because it happened twice before and was correlated.  Correlation is not causation so be wary. Kendu requires faith. Have it, or dont. Scared money dont make money. But dont blindly ape into anything in crypto.    What ive learned from crypto is that it is unpredictable.",11,1739311347.0,2025-02-11 22:02:27
1imwcaw,CoopVelociraptor,"Agree - past performance is not necessarily an indicator of future success.   I’m mostly predicting alt season based on greed - as in there’s substantially more $ to be made by market makers and whales by rotating the $ rather than staying on BTC. Guaranteed, absolutely not… but it’s a fair bet to expect people who like making $ to want to make more $.   I’d be lying through my teeth tho if I said I knew WHEN it starts. We gonna have to wait and see all the same 😅🫡",7,1739317516.0,2025-02-11 23:45:16

1imwcaw,CoopVelociraptor,"Absolutely! It’s impossible to call the unknown as either bullish or bearish, we can only draw conclusions based on the elements we do know and at the end of the day it makes crypto in general an ultra high risk play.

KENDU AUDIT:  Kendu is the second memecoin in history after Pepe to organically reach the 50,000 votes needed for a free CertiK audit.

I started ""working"" by making patches, as in Kendu Unstitched, which was my way to say thank you to the Kendu Street team for their contributions but also get the brand out there in a tangible way...a trinket to show one's Kendu spirit! My initiative continues by, what I call, shill cards, which are business cards and stickers I hand out locally that guide people to Kendu, using a QR code which links to the well-made kendu.io web page; it's like a portal to the greatest decision one could make!

1kdug5k,Hot-Raspberry2758,"I downloaded reddit alittle over a year ago and was looking though it and came across a post for kendu. I glanced at their MC and it was at 10M(googled kendu). A month later I happened across another post from them and decided to go read their reddit page. By this time MC was alittle higher(~15) and decided to buy a small bag. As price rose I continued buying bags, up until 150M MC. After kendu dropped to 6M because of youknowwho, I got nervous(I never sold, never would), but by now, I still has hope in the community.   We started climbing back to 10M, and I saw firsthand how strong and dedicated our community really is. Without our diamond handed members, we would have surely lost it all crashing to 6M. I see and hear what our members are creating irl and I'm glad to be a part of this IRL CRYPTO MOVEMENT! I look forward to when we 🚀 and I'm able to go to irl gatherings( music festivals, ect).

Looked into Kendu, made a small investment, and joined the telegram. Now I help promote Kendu and I have more invested   2. Haven’t tried any IRL stuff but my favourite would be all the beverages that are available or upcoming. They look cool and they’re apparently really good. Unfortunately it’s a bit pricey to get them delivered to Canada right now so I haven’t tried them   3. Favourite thing about Kendu is the community. I know everyone talks about community but Kendu really does have a solid one. There’s always friendly people around, they’re always willing to help, and the project is run by the community. The project is very transparent and friendly because of the community   4. I’m not sure how but Kendu should make posts that are unique. I like the posts that are made about why people should buy Kendu and what Kendu has done or will do. Those are great but a lot of projects have that format. Kendu is unique, some of the posts should be unique too. This post you made is a good example  Take care!",3,1746295028.0,2025-05-03 17:57:08

1id2nmp,Potlimitcrypto,"Price went from 6m-34m in like 48h with news of the CTO. There will be profit takers after a move like that and the onchain market is completely scuffed. I pinned a post in the Telegram which read something like this:  ""Don't worry about ""trending"" now, onchain market is dead with just random narratives running a bit on Sol and fuck all else happening. The #1 priority now is getting F&amp;F networks and extended networks into Kendu. Word of mouth conversions are much more important than X presence right now.  No-one is degenning outside of narratives on Sol. Our efforts are best placed in:  - IRL networks/events/friends and family* - Presence on popular Spaces - Threads - EARLY high viewership X posts (Don't bother with old posts at all)  In that order of importance.""  You can't beat the market, there is none or very little volume Kendu can tap into. But we can gradually build our floor in a market like this in time for the next leg, so that's what we should focus on doing. It's not going to randomly pump to 60m when there is nothing happening onchain.  We're in a market where even Pepe got cut in half. All longs liquidated across thousands of projects and tens upon tens of billions wiped out. It's been a bloodbath. Kendu is holding up very well considering.

Many of us feeling left demotivated or like we were pushing against a brick wall. In hindsight the slow bleed was obvious but its hard to see during the midst of it. He actively worked to create a bad image and to drive away investors, which is why we needed the CTO.  So.. the CTO has happened, supply returned, no more negative imagery on behalf of Kendu. A clean slate.  The absolute only thing holding us back has now left, and we are in the hands of the community.  I genuinely feel so much more motivated again now knowing we can reap the rewards of our efforts with no hindrance.  Im not sure you are in the TG but if you arent you would have seen so so many countless OGs returning. We have KOLs calling us out again for free because they love the community, a 300% jump immediately following the news.  We have now a Kendu we can proudly shill and represent. We have experienced a redistribution period like no other and there is nothing but blue skies ahead.  If there was ever a time where working would be the most beneficial, that time is now.

1id2nmp,DonDengue,"There is a sense of yeah yeah whatever in the market.  How many times will you hear next month watch out!  How many times will you hear “ but we are building a great floor”  Meme coins are like the story of the boy that cried wolf.   Except the wolf that comes is a bull. And at one point you were ready but decided to kill your conviction chasing the odd green candle. Then the bull leaves without you.  Meme coins need people who have disposable income or profits from other coins to flourish.   Life is tough. Crypto is tough.  The hands with cash are not asking “ why down”.. they are just doing their thing and will ape when the time is right.  In a token that has been around a year there are only so many “ family and friends” you can sell to..  All they are hearing is BTC hitting ATH and Trump Family Grift rugging Solana.  And if you can’t say you have made money why should they buy? This applies to all coins you shill.  So the market is thin until the confusion leaves.  Meme coins need the stars to align .  That’s not happening yet, but it will .  Otherwise we have all been sold a tall tail of the Super Meme Coin Cycle.  For the record I believe it will happen.

1id11u3,Potlimitcrypto,"Sounds great in theory but it's a terrible idea in practice. Kendu is a memecoin/brand, it is not a DAO. I have several hundred bad ideas in my DMs at any given time. If we have to vote on them all, we will see our first changes in 2028.  If they are not binding and I can still steer away from the nice-sounding but bad ideas that come my way, and trust me, there are a lot of them, then it will just lead to upset when I say no to an idea that will waste resources and time but the community votes ""yes"" on.  Also, adding this onchain complexity is something very, very, very few people care about. You are a dev, some people are crypto native, but our target audience are NOT technically minded at all. Having snapshot makes Kendu more complex and less attractive. I have extensive experience with DAOs and I can tell you that very few work out as intended. Someone has to steer the ship and make decisions. My vision for Kendu is to move away from onchain and break into the real world with products and services, because this is the best path to growth on the scale we want to achieve, like Pudgy Penguins, and sellotaping a non-binding DAO governance vote on Kendu when that's what we're working towards makes no sense.   If you want to do this, there is nothing stopping you from getting a private group of Kendu holders together, pooling some resources, and then voting on how you should use them or what you should focus on. Assemble a DAO strike force for Kendu and see how it goes.

Adding to this my personal opinion: I think it would be great to introduce this, but would like to highlight the importance of education prior to a vote, ie giving people enough time and also opportunities to discuss and think about proposals. No rushed votes imho.",11,1738177719.0,2025-01-29 19:08:39
1id11u3,lemond4455,"&gt;is there a voting system available in snapshot that allows for double majority, ie it needs the majority of wallets and majority of tokens for a vote to pass?  Yes you can set up custom voting ""strategies"" (the term they use for the approach to voting) that allows for all sorts of criteria like the one you described.  &gt;Im unfamiliar with the technical aspects of snapshots, but do we need to connect our wallets or does it merely track how much tokens are in our wallet address (kind of like a token gate)?  Your wallet is simply used to sign the vote, it doesn't require token spend approvals or anything like that. It does't even require gas as votes are recorded off-chain and then sent as a batched transaction (along with other votes) by Snapshot itself.",2,1738199260.0,2025-01-30 01:07:40

1id11u3,MS_32,"100% agree with the proposal  I threw a similar idea to Josh in telegram and had a little conversation about it, for now he mentioned agile is the way to go which I do agree for the current time, but longer down the line it would fully make sense to have each wallet have their weight in holdings able to vote on important decisions.  While that can be the case I would think for the community leaders it would be weight from their shoulders as well when you can sign crucial topics up for vote and there is no decision per se you as an individual need to make and be held accountable for.  With such an active community I would think the turnout to vote will be quite good.  Would be maybe good to make a poll if this is what community wants or rather be agile and focus on engagement and cex/other chain projects first.",10,1738176819.0,2025-01-29 18:53:39

1iccta6,Leafan1976,That's what I'm thinking too. The upside on Kendu has much more potential.   I am almost certain ETH based coins will see a big influx of cash. As ETH hits ATHs  I know Kendu is a bad ass community that's always pushing hard. Coinbase also steers newbies towards Kendu and Pepe yes.... But it's still going to pay off more for Kendu too ....  PEPE lost like 50% of it's MC over the last couple drops. Seems like they will struggle to recover that drop. Considering that 50% is Billions. We just need to Convince all the people sitting on a bag of PEPE that's down 50% to take the loss and flip what's left into Kendu and we will all recover FAST !!!

1ibpulk,insegniah1,"Each and every person here is just as important as the next.  Maybe you are a new holder, maybe you are a long time holder but someone who has kept on the sidelines, maybe you think that your contribution may not help.  I found Kendu back in may / June and have been here since. I was inducted in to the culture of work and spreading the word and now I find myself today as a loyalist in the TG.  Did I know this was going to happen or that I was working with the aim of achieving that role? Absolutely never did I see that coming.  I saw others working, their enthusiasm, sending in links and showing off different IRL achievements that they had completed in the name of spreading Kendu and that motivated me.  I wanted to help too.  I realised quickly that even though I am by no means a whale, somebody with important crypto connections or just somebody with any kind of pull, I can still contribute to Kendu in massive ways.  I utilise X, reddit, stocktwits, etc. I tell my friends about it, I DM people about it, i make conversations with strangers about it. I do everything within my power.  My point is that you dont need to be “somebody” to help.  We are all equally important in the story of pushing Kendu global, and that is the truth.  We all have the power to make this a worldwide movement, the ability to utilise our unique networks and skills.  Kendu is our canvas and we all should use it to paint our wildest dreams, using it as a vehicle of opportunity.  It is up to each and every one of us to put this in the billions.

But if you're looking to post and shill, Reddit is where we get the most bang for our buck, IMO.

1ikai85,CoopVelociraptor,"Scarnon,  Aussie here! Easiest and cheapest is to buy SOL on either Coinspot or Kraken and transfer it to a Phantom wallet. Can then swap (using the pinned SOL CA) on Phantom for Kendu.  Similar process buying either ETH or BASE and transferring over to your ideal wallet and swapping. I’m not familiar enough with BASE, but the main supply and LP is on ETH it’s just got way more expensive gas for swaps and transfers.

1i97s7r,PrestigiousAd9825,"Price was going downhill for over 6 months as Miazaki started launching projects and ideas that were not in line with the original group goals/unpopular with a large chunk of holders.   Any complaints/tough questions would be banned or scrutinized, and this chronic sell pressure took about 90% of the value out of the coin.   People did some digging and realized Miazaki’s story about these new projects and his holdings didn’t add up - critics of Kendu started spamming about this on CMC and other online spaces.   While this happened, Miazaki got even more dismissive and unhinged, to the point where it started getting legitimately awkward and difficult to contain FUD.   Then, it was announced he would be stepping down from leadership to focus on developing Chads. After this, he snapped and started talking shit about Kendu on social media while dumping his bags.  In response, he got legit doxxed and it became public knowledge that he lied about his age, wealth, connections to Shib, and usage of Kendu funds - with some speculating that he used it to support gambling/drug addictions (no clue how much of this was true but it would explain him being broke).   He was working with Josh to hand off the Telegram, but went rogue and said he wouldn’t be leaving because “Kendu would be nothing without him” or whatever. People threatened to sue/report him to tax authorities for fraud if he didn’t burn his coins, and mysteriously the price tripled in one day of trading, at a time where literally every other coin in the meme space was down HEAVILY.   To my knowledge we no longer have any ties with him, he’s deleted all of his socials and is hiding offline rn, and if he’s still holding any Kendu we aren’t aware of how much or what his wallet address is anymore.   He’s a ghost now. And the community has never felt better for it - vibes are insanely good. We also have a new Telegram chat bc he tried seizing the old one obvi",67,1737758345.0,2025-01-24 22:39:05

1i97s7r,Environmental_Set_49,"So many ways to tell a story…   In the spring of 2024 good animals from all around the kingdom were drawn to the Kendu forest because of its community atmosphere and the way it encouraged everyone to be the very best version of themselves. A wild but enthusiastic wolf welcomed them in and showed them around. There was so much possibility and creativity. The space brimmed with sunshine and the sounds of the Forrest animals hard at work.  However, in time it slowly became more obvious that something was amiss. The wolf that claimed to be in charge of the space turned out not to be as genuine and community-oriented as he’d led the other animals to believe. It was hard to believe. Could his intentions actually be malicious? At first it was just a small cloud hanging overhead but day by day the sky grew darker.  Animals that questioned him were ex-communicated from the Forrest under the logic that FUD brings down the whole community. The truth in this made it all the more confusing for the animals that remained. Where was the line of FUDing one’s bags and asking healthy and reasonable questions? The animals kept working and encouraging each other but the sky grew darker.  Until one day, the wolf went too far, everyone started to see the same thing at the same time and began to call out, “Kendu is community!” It was to become our rallying cry and the common value that would move us forward. Those who were already leaders among us rose up, took charge, and with strength, grace, and an unflinching vision lead us through CTO and into a clearing, where the clouds had begun to part, and a beautiful beam of sunlight poured down onto all the different Forrest animals, illuminating the values of mutual support and community that had kept us all there through the darkest days.  Over the following days the sky cleared and soft fluffy white clouds passed by on a bright blue sky. Animals that had left began to come back and everyone got to work sweeping up winter’s fallen leaves and getting ready for a bright and verdant early spring. The energy was infectious, everyone was more excited than ever to get to work building a brand new world.",2,1737956158.0,2025-01-27 05:35:58

1i8p2em,[deleted],One thing that blows my mind which you covered perfectly is the unanimous decision for Josh to be in charge. There was no vote or election needed... No power struggle or insurrections. The community UNANIMOUSLY asked this guy to lead us and he graciously accepted. Do you realize how fucking insane that is?? I've seen more drama out of 4 friends deciding what to order for lunch. But Kendu community has its shit together and is finally moving as one well-organized unit. Optimism and morale are at all time highs and soon the price will be as well. Very exciting times for all Kendu chads and chadettes. $KENDU LFG!!,42,1737700533.0,2025-01-24 06:35:33

1i8p2em,boathouse_floats,"We recovered 13,000,000,000 Kendu tokens from the Chads wallet which are now housed in the marketing wallet. Although we don't have the full amount, the Kendu we do have will be used for its original purpose!",29,1737700942.0,2025-01-24 06:42:22
1i8p2em,RegardedQt314,"i think the best case scenario will be that as the Kendu token rises in price, the chad NFTs will also grow in value simply due to the lore connecting the two.  as far as the promise of getting rewards based off fees from trading on the platform, i would just accept the reality that it won't happen.  a silver lining is that some of the funds from the chads mint is in the treasury now so at least we can actually utilize some of it for growing Kendu.   like the post outlines, miazaki has ownership of the domain, contract, and royalties so it is out of our hands unfortunately.",28,1737701031.0,2025-01-24 06:43:51
1i8p2em,Vegas_42,"Top 50 holder here. Thought a lot about this. One option going forward is to get in contact with Geoff/Miazaki and ask him to launch the platform. He stated it is ready to launch and he's going to continue working on it. While the state of the launch is most probably not true, he might have a self-interest in launching the platform. He holds 1100 chads and he is in desperate need of passive income to fund his ""lifestyle"". Very sad, but that's how I see it.  If he's not doing it, we should bring to his mind, that it's questionable but maybe (big maybe) not punishable to dump KENDU on the community. Whereas selling NFTs as parts of a company/platform with the promise of passive earnings and intentionally not delivering is fraud and surely will give him jail-time. To quote him: gloves are off. We should force him and make crystal clear that we will not accept a ""fake"" platform which is unsuccessfull from the beginning due to lack of engagement. He took millions of $ from investors and is obliged to deliver.  Finally, we should figure out a coordinated way to enforce this. It would be great to have support from the leadership team since appr. 1000 chads are affected.  Edit: to make this clear: chads is not going to be part of KENDU in the future as stated in the initial post. Only chad holders getting what they paid for - earning ETH from fees.",16,1737702943.0,2025-01-24 07:15:43

1i8p2em,Potlimitcrypto,"Personally think distancing from Miazaki and his initiatives is the best move... It's the same reason that there is no association with Mega, Anarchy, Bueno, Freak and any other shitcoins they launched.  If he delivered Chads and it was subpar, which has a 99% probability, then it's a bad look for us. If he comes back to do it it's an even worse look.",17,1737709726.0,2025-01-24 09:08:46

Eth and major stables will be accepted, no other tokens.  The process:   1) You will DM me with the amount you want to buy. 2) You will send that amount to the crowdfund wallet address: 0xD22849fcB4C83389E65a1c40748a9b67157638A3 3) You will share the TX hash with me.  4) I will return the same value in $KENDU to an address you specify in DMs.  Do not begin sending without first arranging with me in DM.

Those left are the people who still believe in Kendu. Are we wrong or right to do so, it could be the new Eldorado like you mentionned or it could be the 10th level of hell, only time will tell. One thing I know is that the community is not going to stop working  Since then, Kendu has ""CTO""ed and taken a new direction. The fundamentals remain the same. This is a coin with an emphasis on the community and spreading the words through the members. With Kendu being on ETH, SOL wormhol and coming to base, it keeps building even in the red market  Also the last 3 months has been pretty harsh to alts/memecoins. If you look at PEPE and other big memecoins, they all took a hit and so did Kendu  Let's not forget that this is a memecoin, it is a high risk high reward type of coin.

The cult mentality gets you so far, but not as far as substance. If Kendu is going to bounce back, it’s going to be a result of a combination of fundamentals and the community. Right now we have all of the latter and none of the former. ",21,1737333014.0,2025-01-20 00:30:14

1i5dgcg,whipstickagopop,"There will be other projects that will grow during the bull run. Kendu hasn't shown anything, quite the opposite  even before recent events. Feels like an uphill battle for this one so why wait and not just invest elsewhere even if it's a non meme coin. Meme coins are always a lotto ticket and you try to pick the best one, this seems like the worst lotto ticket.",0,1737414536.0,2025-01-20 23:08:56
1i5dgcg,wr0ngdr01d,"Frankly I think you’re right at the moment. I personally haven’t aped any more in since DCAing down a bit 5 months ago or so and have played other coins while most of my bags sit in safer, not meme coins. Not a huge bag and just did a lot of the free stuff like smashing posts and voting and trying to be positive but realistic and not FUD here.   I think what attracted a lot of people is there were some promises and moves - some of which were delivered and some weren’t - that actually made it seem like a better lotto ticket than a lot of the others. A community that believed in the project was a lot more promising than a lot of the “QUICK BUY THIS TOKEN NOW 1000X NO RISK aaaaand it’s gone” tokens out there.   If miazaki had been the guy he said he was to get this community excited about the project in the first place, it could’ve gone huge places. ",1,1737415192.0,2025-01-20 23:19:52

1i5dgcg,RegardedQt314,"first off, glad to hear you still have good feelings for the project 🫡  secondly, i agree with your thoughts.  i think such deep conviction for the project kind of made some people hyper defensive and this lead to a lot of unnecessary confrontation.  sometimes it's hard to accept criticism, but ultimately having these kinds of conversations tends to lead to a positive outcome.  which leads into my next point which is that i still want to emphasize that there has to be a level of respect from both sides for progress to be made.  it's easy to be abrasive in this anonymous space when sharing opinions, but it doesn't usually lead to a meaningful conversation.    i think as long as people come from a genuine place of wanting to build the project, going forward, there should be more room for criticism definitely.",13,1737337455.0,2025-01-20 01:44:15

1i5dgcg,Consistent_Risk_6052,"Like many, I was initially drawn to Kendu by its promising roadmap, enthusiastic community, and the potential for significant returns. The project's buzz was undeniable, and the developer (Dev) was portrayed as a visionary who could deliver on Kendu’s ambitious goals.  For a time, the optimism felt justified. The community thrived, and the project appeared to be progressing. I invested in Kendu, believing in its promise and in the individuals spearheading the project. However, as time went on, cracks began to form beneath the surface.     Everything changed when the Kendu developer was doxxed. Suddenly, the illusion shattered, and I saw the person behind the project for who they truly were. To put it plainly, I didn’t like what I saw. Their actions, behavior, and decisions were not aligned with the integrity I had hoped for in a project leader.  I voiced my concerns publicly. I felt a responsibility to call out what I perceived as red flags, even though I knew it might be unpopular. What followed was a swift and severe backlash.  Instead of engaging in constructive dialogue, my concerns were dismissed outright. I was mocked and ridiculed for my views, booted from most Kendu-related social channels, and alienated from a community I once believed in. The rejection was painful, but I stood by my convictions. I had a clear sense of where Kendu was heading, and I knew I couldn’t stay silent.  Months passed, and one by one, the warnings I had issued manifested into reality. The very issues I had raised—leadership failures, project mismanagement, and unmet promises—became undeniable. While I took no pleasure in being proven right, it was validating to see my instincts confirmed.",4,1737368418.0,2025-01-20 10:20:18
1i5dgcg,diablero_T,"Yo Chad, crazy you say that, I thought his whole doxxing was a bad decision as well.  I felt like he made that decision at that time bc the market was tanking and people were just kinda feeling uneasy in general.  If he actually is RYOSHI (I personally believe that to be true), it means that crazy mfer created $SHIB.   Now just think about that for a sec.

1i56kln,Big-Finding2976,"Yeah. I'm no expert so maybe it's not as easy as it sounds, but I think it's possible to keep the same name and ticker and just move to a new contract address.  Another option might be to either move over to SOL if KM  mainly holds ETH bags, or even fork to a different chain entirely, maybe Base, SUI, or XRD, which is easier to use and has much lower fees than ETH and can cope with high traffic, unlike SOL.",1,1737368027.0,2025-01-20 10:13:47
1i56kln,cryptosader,"the move part won't actually help if its the same coin because you can just bridge your coins to whatever chain you migrate to, like iwhats happening with the sol bridge where a lot of holders didn't buy the coin on solana just bridged their eth kendu coins and dumped them there in order to arbitrage the prices.     As for the 1st option as i said its feasible but it would require a lot work especially filtering the bad actors out (most of the addresses are anonymous) so it would be a pain to verify which is which, not impossible though and would remove a good chunk of those that are working against kendu. Lets just keep it as an idea for now , because hopefully KM and his lovers decide for a truce and we won't need to do anything except work for kendu to be where it belongs.",2,1737369027.0,2025-01-20 10:30:27

We are recently coming out a brutal, brutal market with ETH falling 50% this year alone, yet Kendu has stuck strong and has doubled since the CTO!!!  There is a bull run coming and Kendu is gonna bounce back and soar past ATH. I can say my opinion on how high we will go, but no one truly knows......   I bought in June and have never ever had a green day in Kendu, I have been in a loss for nearly 11 months and yet I remain as bullish as ever and keep buying more. Why?  Because I look around and see the strongest community in the space currently, we are dominating Reddit and Twitter. In terms of pure metrics, kendu is keeping up with some of the strongest coins in crypto(even those in the hundreds of millions), in real life we are setting an unprecedented standard!  Shib, Pepe all went through very tough and brutal periods, but this is so important to reduce sell pressure when we move past the big milestones(100 million, 1billion, 10 billion)  It has been proven time and time again that community only matters and that community determines the value of a memecoin, Kendu is no different  Are you in the tg?

I’m not gonna name any other coins but if you look at any of the ones that have been around for awhile everything is down 50-90%.  Kendu is and will always be my biggest conviction play.

If you want the far safer bet of something like XRP or something, well hey that's valid too. You just miss out on the potential upside potential.   But if your staying in the memecoin sphere, I cant think of any alternative besides KENDU.   Stay strong my man, don't get shaken out.

1i4hhvg,PrestigiousAd9825,"Here's the first list of three for project objectives I've written up:  **OBJECTIVE 1: BE INEVITABLE**  *Strategy 1a: Get space for Kendu IRL*  I know some folks were surprised to see how much presence coins like $HEGE and $POWSCHE were able to get with a smaller MC than ours, and how flash-in-the-pan projects like $CHILLGUY were able to spring up seemingly overnight - but it made complete sense to me considering those were the only projects I've ever seen in local, public spaces (think stickers on stop signs and the like).  We have something even more powerful with Kendu - a large team of creative minds who know how to build branded products and services. With a little investment and some tactical thinking, we could blow the lid wide open in where people can see, find, and ask about us and what we're up to.  Ex. The NFL's NFC Championship Game is happening next Sunday. Let's say Detroit wins this week and gets to host it at home. Why do we not have a group of Detroit-based chads yet who's job it is to hand out Kendu Energy drinks for free at the tailgate? We could develop a community fund to expense sending the drinks there, pay the chads involved a little bonus for their time/shilling work, and use the photos to promote on social media the way Red Bull has.  *Strategy 1b: Find our tribe where others aren't looking*  The most bullish aspect of this cycle for me has been hearing from people who aren't invested in crypto. I've met people who refuse to buy BTC because they think it's ""destroying the environment"" and others who have only even heard of meme coins because of that Hawk Tuah fiasco.  We need to find people who may not be curious themselves about the crypto space yet, but who are still a little curious about why others have gotten into it so much. The kind of people who feel a sense of FOMO because they weren't in on the in-crowd when $GME exploded and feel a sense of injustice around big money calling the shots with their retirement.  Seeing the massive influx of people leaving TikTok for an even more Chinese-based social media app out of spite against the Supreme Court showed me that this rebel streak is alive and well in everyday people - so if we can get a message out that says ""you don't have to bet your life savings to get enough money to pay for your life savings"", it'll build up our holder count, talent base, and general awareness/hype.  Ex. We should start posting memes in places that naturally attract people who would want to root for Kendu - think forums about getting off the grid, cybersecurity-related SM groups, and anywhere else people are worried they won't be able to pull their money out of their bank someday.  *Strategy 1c: A job for every Chad*  If there's a mistake I think this project has made so far, it's been pausing the development of groups/teams for specialized projects that play to their skillsets. We have artists, creatives, marketers, computer programmers, finance nerds, and PR specialists in this group that would be springing headfirst into the action if they didn't worry they'd be looked at as a control freak or rogue by suggesting anything new. This has to change if we want to take full advantage of the opportunity we have.  We should sit down and define our need state for this type of talent - thinking out any scenario we could need someone from the group to flex their skills on our behalf. Maybe there's a TG chat specifically for legal experts or people connected to them that can help us navigate the regulatory process. Maybe we have another just for writers/press specialists who focus on how we position the project in interviews and media quotes. Another for designers and graphic artists to create specific brand guidelines for how the Kendu brand looks in print and on your computer screen.  It shouldn't just be ""let's get to work"" - every chad should either have a space to collaborate with people of a similar professional background/interest, or at the very least, the freedom to eventually be trusted to build that out with leadership once the skill becomes needed and pressing.",3,1737238527.0,2025-01-18 22:15:27
1i4hhvg,PrestigiousAd9825,"**OBJECTIVE 2: NEVER LAND ON OUR BACK HEEL**  *Strategy 2a: Reinforce our floor*  Before we hit ATH, there were several instances where a whale would sell and it would cause a sharp drop in less than an hour (kind of like last night). What would normally be seen as a time to placate holders and stop the bleeding instead became a challenge to get people to double down on their investment - and within hours we would eat the dip so violently it created a butterfly effect where other chads who didn't initially buy in the trough would send more money in to keep the momentum moving and push the price up as quickly as possible. I'd like to recreate that by strategizing how we talk about buying Kendu. The massive benefit we have this time around is exchange access - even if we're still fighting to play with the big boys. If I were to see a chad worrying in the chat about whether it was ""too late"" to profit from a price recovery, I'd give them my honest advice - which is that it doesn't have to be.  Coins that can jump 40%+ in a day look attractive to jeets and uncommitted buyers, but if we start recommending during rallies for people to set aside what they would have thrown into the project and save it for a rainy day by leveraging limit trading, we can recreate this even more efficiently than we have in the past. Prices are cyclical in crypto - burnout from buying high and having to sell low isn't. I legit think we should start directing people who haven't done so already to get onto the exchanges and sink their cash into a grid of buys that makes it harder for those drops to get worse. Even if a whale comes back and tries a flash crash to sell all of their position, I can't imagine it'll be a bad thing when half the chat just boosted their position 20% without having to think or worry about the price because it's already recovered from that low.  This strat also gives us more bandwidth to regulate our growth - people who'd be tempted or may feel guilty taking profit on a 20-40% rally may feel better about doing so if they're not worried it'll be our last green candle. I bet a bunch of them would even do so only to recover a larger position - but they only will if they think Kendu is trending UP. This is critical if we want larger community participation while the new system of leadership takes shape.  *Strategy 2b: Create a plan around our ethos*  A huge part of the community spirit that has dwindled over the last few months is the enthusiasm around the main idea of the project - taking control of your future in crypto by creating a project that is designed to succeed because it's not designed to do anything else. This idea of not hiding behind ""use cases"" like Kendu Chads ""revolutionizing the NFT market"" and making the process of understanding how this project will earn money easy to learn is going to be massive to scale this thing up further.  That's no shade to Chads either - I own three of them myself. I just happen to think they look a lot more valuable to people who see them as a way to ladder up future profit instead of as the sole catalyst that will make us money in the long term. Whether it's Kendu Labs coins, the SOL projects, or anything touching NFTs, it makes our core offering a much tougher sell to new members and will not give people disaffected by crypto a reason to care about the narrative. Does it have to take a back seat? No. But it should at the very least be riding shotgun when we're making a first impression with skeptics and newcomers.  Also - this might be petty, but I'd love to start keeping receipts on negative CoinGecko and CMC comments. Imagine if you were just learning about Kendu and peeped the chart, only to see a comment calling the project ""dead"" followed by a response days later showing a full recovery + some growth with triple the likes on it. Feels like a missed opportunity to organize keeping this negativity in check.  *Strategy 2c: Use transparency to drive focus*  Speaking of which, the haters of this project have also picked up on the lack of transparency we currently have and are trying to beat us over the head with it. It's taken all of our latest accomplishments, like being the first project in the history of the blockchain to vote their way to a free Certik audit, and drowned them out in the noise of skepticism and FUD from complete strangers. We cannot arm these people with the tools to own our public spaces online.  Voting for 5-star ratings on CMC and Lewk is a great start, but there's nothing more valuable to our long-term optics than being able to sit in our truth and own that we truly are what we stand for. I think this means re-committing to the idea of being positive and aspirational - to get even people who think we're all crazy to start rooting for us because they see we're trying to do something, and aren't just playing an elaborate game of follow-the-leader with someone who hasn't delivered on the shots they've called.  People shouldn't care about us because they think they might be able to watch someone staple a sheet of paper to their forehead - they should care because they can understand what we're trying to do and see how collaborative the process of making something great can be. That's what wins us holder count, investment, and a fighting shot at these elusive T1 exchanges.",3,1737240830.0,2025-01-18 22:53:50

Let them know that we appreciate their efforts. It doesn’t matter if we voted for them or if we agree with all their decisions. What matters is that we all stand together and are doing everything we can to help take crypto to the next level. We can do that by making sure the people that help make the regulations and policies know that we are watching and appreciate the efforts they have made. People tend to work harder when they know their efforts are appreciated and don’t go in vain. We now need to do our part in this great revolution, so let’s put our hands and brains to work!

1iygepm,Unique_Opposite2026,"If you are able to then DCA. This not only helps you to lower the average cost of your token, i.e. you will break even sooner, but also helps the community by having more buys (demand for the token increase). My average purchase was 75 M MC end of last year. Now I’m at average purchase MC of &lt;40 M and still buy when I can.  I was always planning to increase my bag, now is the time. I kick myself for not being able to buy yesterday at &lt; 7 M MC…",15,1740560928.0,2025-02-26 09:08:48

1iygepm,phi_curious,Why would DCA be bad?  If you believe Kendu will rise again then buying more means your average cost will go down and you will break even earlier.  If you don’t believe that Kendu will ever go up again then there isn’t a point in holding at all.,5,1740589479.0,2025-02-26 17:04:39
