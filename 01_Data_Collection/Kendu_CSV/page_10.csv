1jksnpm,RegardedQt314,"if you scroll through the subreddit most of the major past and upcoming things are posted.  the main planned event would be the miami festival like hot-raspberry mentioned which looks great so far from the teasers.  i know a team of chads are building a Kendu game and it sounds like they are taking it pretty serious so we'll see what that ends up looking like.  i also believe the new website should be done in the near future but there is no set date.  other than that, most things happen in real time and people just kind do what they want for the project so there isn't necessarily a defined roadmap or planned events usually.  i would definitely keep updated and like i mentioned, major events and stuff will always be shared in this subreddit.",24,1743044813.0,2025-03-27 03:06:53
