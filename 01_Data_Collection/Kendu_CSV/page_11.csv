1jj17di,phi_curious,"Easy answer is: more buy pressure, than sell pressure.  It’s a combination of factors why that is the case: we had one bigger whale selling for a few months and this whale slowed down (and afaik sold most he was holding originally), so less sell pressure. Also, some events may create new buy pressure, ie we have a big event coming up in Miami and that will probably bring in people already (connections that are made during organization, radio advertisements for the event, etc.",52,1742848829.0,2025-03-24 20:40:29

1jioigt,TheGDC33,Thanks they seem to be gathering steam and heating up. I hope and believe we will continue this momentum. In fact I hope we keep a steady climb building our base holders and growing the volume for a number of weeks. Will be great if we do so and maybe in a month or two we see a massive pump,1,1742858107.0,2025-03-24 23:15:07
