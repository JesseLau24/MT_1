1jiih2v,RegardedQt314,"not sure how long it's been since you've been updated on Kendu, but the kendu chads platform hasn't been a part of the ecosystem since the CTO took place so it's not really that much of a surprise.  the previous dev had the sole access to it and when he split from the project it was on him as to whether or not to release it fully which evidently he chose not too.  this is an extremely brief summary of what happened and there's a lot more to the story than that but it's really not worth diving into.   still unfortunate yes, but it's in the past.",18,1742793232.0,2025-03-24 05:13:52

1jftopn,phi_curious,"i already mentioned this in tg, but will repeat here for the reddit folks:  chat did feel more lively today. not that it isnt active on other days (it certainly is), just noticed a faster pace today.   Nice to see that reflected in the numbers compared to a few days ago.     I love how this ""**America—Greatest at Being Great**? (...) Cryptobiker1's patriotic jest"" could be misunderstood at biker being American hahahahaha  Who is gonna tell him?",8,1742490314.0,2025-03-20 17:05:14
