Just try to look at yourself as in individual and think, what can I do in this situation. Not even considering $KENDU, just as a whole in life.  Focus on growth, focus on output, focus on the positives. That’s what counts in my opinion. Don’t yap about “sell-pressure” when the market is going sideways for weeks.  Complaining gets you nowhere in life.  Taking action and going forward will.  May I ask, why do you think we are going to 0?",7,1742311787.0,2025-03-18 15:29:47

1jcso1l,TheGDC33,"Great job with the work. I have to say it is probably easiest and gets the most notice (this is what I have been told about the X algorithm and maybe all socials algorithms) that we need to do a reply chain to get notice. I had to scroll to find your reply (which I had already liked, reposted and bookmarked earlier) which many people won't do. We want to show up in force.   Feel free to check in the TG with someone to confirm if what I am saying is best for the algorithm. My suggestion is include your reply in the post for those who mostly scroll Reddit, but do a little X.
