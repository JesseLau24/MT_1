1jb9pt0,phi_curious,Question: did you do stuff like this before? Or was kendu the special motivation to push you over the edge to do it for the first time?,2,1742027919.0,2025-03-15 08:38:39
1jb9pt0,UrbanPKMonkey,Similar but not to this level. It’s been a good learning curve 😬,2,1742043859.0,2025-03-15 13:04:19

1jb9pt0,phi_curious,"love the summaries, i feel like it is getting better with the summaries, even though Lornikos feet not being mentioned is a big dissapointment lol (I understand why though with the token limit you mentioned)",5,1741974686.0,2025-03-14 17:51:26
1jb9pt0,UrbanPKMonkey,I did a count of how many times ‘feet’ was mentioned and it was only 7 times in the last 24H period 😂,3,1741975499.0,2025-03-14 18:04:59
1jb9pt0,phi_curious,That sounds off. Ngl. But obviously depends on the exact time frame. When i search feet manually in TG it’s been mentioned over 30 times yesterday and today.,6,1741975646.0,2025-03-14 18:07:26
1jb9pt0,UrbanPKMonkey,"I thought it was off too. I need to double check that, and it may be because I am discounting memes and images.",3,1741975733.0,2025-03-14 18:08:53
1jb9pt0,phi_curious,"in the end it doesnt really matter, it would just be funny because of lornikos reaction and I could rub his feet under his nose for a while haha",4,1741977507.0,2025-03-14 18:38:27
1jb9pt0,UrbanPKMonkey,He just needs to set up an Only Feet page 😂,5,1741979561.0,2025-03-14 19:12:41

1jb9pt0,phi_curious,"hmm interesting, i guess it make sense whenever the cut off was. We can do better. Even though I dont think there was much talk about ""J33ting"" at all, so probably it is a mix between limitations of chat gpt and when the cut off was.",4,1741977472.0,2025-03-14 18:37:52
1jb9pt0,UrbanPKMonkey,"The problem is getting thorough discussions, and the only way to get that is through replies and reactions metrics. I tried using top keywords when I was concepting it but the convos were fragmented and didn’t make sense. Threaded convos worked best for summarisation.",4,1741979523.0,2025-03-14 19:12:03
1jb9pt0,phi_curious,That makes a lot of sense. Thank you for explaining!,3,1741979581.0,2025-03-14 19:13:01
1jazqsr,TheGDC33,I will definitely not be giving you financial advice though I do believe in our community and Kendu. You have to make this decision yourself even if I do like the way you're thinking!   What I can say is that we are all responsible for making the good moves happen even yourself. We all have a role to play to propel this project forward and spread it far and wide.,25,1741950951.0,2025-03-14 11:15:51
1jazqsr,Honos11,What other alts do you hold?  I love Kendu but as they say you don't actually lose till you sell.  So I wouldn't sell alts that one can reasonably believe will recover at some point.  But that's just me.,20,1741950721.0,2025-03-14 11:12:01
1jazqsr,p0tatemoon,"if you are invested in a lot of alts, you might want to chose those that you really believe in and that have the potential to go back up again  Personally, I would recommend diversifying a bit instead of having all your eggs in one basket  Like the others said, it will be your decision to make",15,1741956134.0,2025-03-14 12:42:14

1jazqsr,insegniah1,"Not that this should in any way make your decision for you or try and encourage it -  But many of us here are 100% in kendu. Myself included.  Thats actually why im so confident on this project too, as so many holders are completely dedicated to kendu. Being 100% in means people give it their all.  Of course you make what decisions are best for you, but what you are suggesting isnt on the realm of “crazy” and is actually what many of us already do :)",6,1742020897.0,2025-03-15 06:41:37

1jb1fs3,phi_curious,"Pretty sure it was true, I was in TG at the time. And we got a lot of these sellers showing up at that time. Usually that’s a good indicator lol",8,1741953498.0,2025-03-14 11:58:18

1jan05c,UrbanPKMonkey,You know I might pull some historic data out just to have a look 👀,7,1741908377.0,2025-03-13 23:26:17
1jan05c,phi_curious,That would be really interesting. And also could be motivational. Don’t know anything about how hard the data processing is. But do you think one could correlate the MC with activity? Because we all feel how the heat turns up when the charts get a bit of green. Would be cool to see.,8,1741908586.0,2025-03-13 23:29:46

1jan05c,phi_curious,"Sounds good I’ll dm you some later :) is there any time restraint? Or can it go as far back as the creation of the TG?

1j8wb7c,phi_curious,"How so? Feel free to elaborate. I am not quite sure which direction you are thinking, but neither are any copyrights required nor is it unusual for different businesses to sell their product with a common label.",8,1741716531.0,2025-03-11 18:08:51
1j8wb7c,TheTruth116,It just takes one person to copyright the name Kendu then every person who uses it regardless of their business will get sued. Just don’t see this ending well,1,1741719056.0,2025-03-11 18:50:56
1j8wb7c,phi_curious,"That isn't how copyright/trademarks work, or lets say it highly depends on the jurisdictional context. In the end everybody who starts a business needs to know for themselves what kind of legal protection they deem necessary. Imho that has nothing to with us as ""Kendu on ETH (and base and sol)""",9,1741725071.0,2025-03-11 20:31:11
1j8wb7c,lorniko,"I just checked. To copyright a brand in a majority of countries it can cost more than 100k $ per year, it depends on how many countries your target. Moreover, you register in each world region, you protect it worldwide that simple.  And even if someone had 100k$ to pay each year to copyright ""kendu"", then ""kendu energy"" ""kendu coffee"" etc aren't under copyright.  So, it is quite safe.",6,1741727827.0,2025-03-11 21:17:07
1j8wb7c,CHARLIEFORTHEBOYS,At this point you would not be able to trademark the kendu name and logo based on the fair use of it the past year,6,1741745300.0,2025-03-12 02:08:20
