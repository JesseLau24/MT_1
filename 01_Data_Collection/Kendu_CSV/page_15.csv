1j7vqrg,TheGDC33,Yeah it is promising from a community standpoint. At some point we will all look back and laugh at how shitty the market was and how much fear was around and the green rocket party it turned into. When that will happen though I must admit I have no confident estimate. I am hoping later this year 🤞 and not longer,4,1741631536.0,2025-03-10 18:32:16

1j7u7pa,RegardedQt314,not to get to into PvP but it's funny when i see these polls with us now winning when before im pretty sure we lost to a couple of the other coins on this poll.  that community grind fades so fast with others if they are not seeing green consistently.  Kendu really does stand alone and is so consistent with the output and positive sentiment no matter what.  that's an obvious sign to me that the long term is valued highly in the Kendu community 🔥,3,1741647276.0,2025-03-10 22:54:36
1j7s0s0,insegniah1,"Goal is to just outpace the sellers  More buy volume then sell volume = price go up  We are just getting out the last couple very early whales and sell pressure is massively easing  Where we are now in MC is a good capitulation zone in where believers get cheap kendu and sellers go through it quickly  The other factor is just how dead the market is, its gard to extract volume from eth considering the gwei hasnt been above 1 in over a month  All we got to do is keep working and accumulating in the meantime, and there will come a day that sell pressure is gone and we have a leg up  That could be tomorrow, next week, next month  Crypto is a matter of patience",23,1741587805.0,2025-03-10 06:23:25

I put all my money in $Kendu over a period of time starting last May. This was an opportunity that I couldn’t afford to miss. The risk vs reward was too high. Do I sometimes have doubts? Of course, we all do. However, that feeling of when it’s green is more powerful. We are inevitable. Even back to ATH is a 25x and with what we have built and continuing to build giving up now would be more than stupid. They always say very few people stay on the ride to the top which is true.

1j41lg8,TheGDC33,"Yeah well I wish I had been willing to listen to others or more importantly I wish I knew how to properly track transactions and wallet watch myself or at least done more digging when the Doxx happened, but I couldn't and didn't.   Kendu is stronger than ever and I have no doubt that we will make some really positive moves when the market actually turns with a positive sentiment and an injection of liquidity into more risky assets. Maybe even some QE and whatever else can turn this ship around for good. Time will tell, but that shit really did suck, but it is over now and we have moved on and are better than ever.",5,1741220265.0,2025-03-06 00:17:45
1j41lg8,KenduGNX,"Yeah dude. Look at the wider market. Memecoins are bleeding to death and Kendu is holding its ground very nicely in comparison.   We have been a CTO for well over a month, whatever the previous dev does has nothing to do with Kendu and I can tell you for a fact that the Kendu community isn’t falling for anything.

1j41lg8,TheGDC33,I can see your comments and tell you would be considered a troll by many. I would argue you are just uninformed on the cycles and the movement of Memecoins. You came for massive gains but weren't informed (research and reading) enough to understand you will also have to likely suffer massive drawdowns. That part is on you. This is a painful and crazy game and I am not sure I am having fun with price action but I do love the community and I know the assignment. This is what I signed up for. Don't buy the ticket if you can't handle the ride.  I wish you well in your investing arc. You can always select something way way safer. BTC is a great option if you want crypto or just mutual funds,5,1741194618.0,2025-03-05 17:10:18
1j41lg8,Charming-Hurry6649,"Bullshit - in the end, all these stories are there to keep the people in holding the coin instead of cutting losses. they are used as exit liquidity… there wont be any value of kendu and probably in the next ,bull‘ run some other, newer and frsher coins will do it.",1,1741256894.0,2025-03-06 10:28:14
1j41lg8,TheGDC33,"I stand by my comment. This is how memecoins move and crypto is extremely volatile overall. Look up the price action of SHIB from last cycle or even how Pepe started...same thing, just massive draw downs. That doesn't mean it happens with every coin because the market is saturated with garbage. But it is fact and it isn't just lightning striking.  https://preview.redd.it/4eqfomzx32ne1.jpeg?width=1050&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a04d9f89ba9ef4892e88c72b9a5599c77cc1e58f  Better if you find the PEPE chart yourself. Good luck with your investments though, plenty of options",2,1741261336.0,2025-03-06 11:42:16
1j41lg8,p0tatemoon,"Seems like you are describing 99% of the memecoins  Kendu does have a value which puts it in the 1%. To know the value, one will have to DYOR. If a person doesn't see the value then it is ok the leave Kendu on the side and continue to search for another investment   As I always say, memecoins are a high risk high reward investment. DYOR is mandatory. If someone doesn't believe in the project, please cut the losses and invest in something you have properly done your research and believe in  I believe in Kendu, only time will tell if I was right or wrong.
