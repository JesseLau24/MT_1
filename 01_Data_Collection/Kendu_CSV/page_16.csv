1j2iwba,phi_curious,"Great question, I didnt even think so far.  Only option I see for reddit are profile pics. Because user names that show up in the posts are not editable.  We also would have to agree on something that we all can do, like the fox and helmet on X. So either an orange background that slaps, or adding a helmet like this one.     EDIT: or if we can make a customizable reddit avatar that is free to use. Anyone knows if we have done something like that? I dont like it as much, because there is just something special about seeing your current pic in a new version. Just sharing ideas.  https://preview.redd.it/liv4f64rehme1.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16015559174b4f8c0dc505e0719e61874c39d006",18,1741010772.0,2025-03-03 14:06:12

It’s simple to understand yet difficult to implement: community.  It’s the only thing that can persist in a world of KOLs, cabals, pump &amp; dumps, farming, slow pulls (did I get it all?)…  So glad to be here amongst the conviction and action of our Chads / Chadettes.

Also, look at how other communities are dealing with the overall market sentiment and how the Kendu community keeps working and pushing initiatives like the OP.   The Kendu community is continuing to build through the rough conditions and when sentiment turns we will be in prime position to ride the wave to the top. Hope to see you there with us!",14,1740838983.0,2025-03-01 14:23:03
1j0ozgs,p0tatemoon,"100% agree. Let's even compare the moral of the community and the work / development that is put into Kendu vs other memecoins that have declined in price. Some coins just die after a few days and weeks  Kendu's price has also been dropping but on the other hand we are still working and putting value into the coin. Once the market turns around, people will definitely see Kendu as undervalued",7,1740850376.0,2025-03-01 17:32:56
