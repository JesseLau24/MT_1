1izxnaj,Specific-Sundae5117,"This is great, I think our whole community should raid the social media pages of Trump and other members of his team as well as other politicians from all over the world that support crypto to thank them for their hard work and support. Let them know that we appreciate their efforts. It doesn’t matter if we voted for them or if we agree with all their decisions. What matters is that we all stand together and are doing everything we can to help take crypto to the next level. We can do that by making sure the people that help make the regulations and policies know that we are watching and appreciate the efforts they have made. People tend to work harder when they know their efforts are appreciated and don’t go in vain. We now need to do our part in this great revolution, so let’s put our hands and brains to work! Let them know who we are! Let’s push this amazing community and the whole crypto revolution one step further!!!",4,1740849753.0,2025-03-01 17:22:33

Look at the small pump yesterday, we def felt the effect of that.  So when alt season comes around, whenever that is, we're going up.
