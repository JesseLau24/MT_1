1ixezyz,SpeakerClassic4418,"The kendu community.  Join the TG.  Work with us.  The more you work, the more you get to know the team, the more you joke and have fun, just everything energizes you.     There is a constant rotation of people from around the world participating.  When I'm in the TG in the morning, it has different people then my afternoon or night, etc.    We motivate each other.  It's infectious.",37,1740437038.0,2025-02-24 22:43:58
1ixezyz,BroskiNatanyahu,This is a good way to feel the energy    Thank you,29,1740438669.0,2025-02-24 23:11:09
1ixezyz,p0tatemoon,"to be honest, I see it like a workout. I make a daily/weekly plan and I follow through. I can miss a day put I try not to miss 2 days in a row  For example, an easy one would be a morning routine :  Designated 10-15min morning routine to Kendu while having my coffee   * Upvote : Kendu on coingecko, coinmarketcap, certik, lewk, etc... * Check new post/repost on X by main account : like and leave a comment * Check kendu reddit : like all post and comments, leave comments  Then you can add extra stuffs like going on TG, smash all pin post, search for $KENDU on X and smash, print business card/ stickers and leave them around town, shilling in real life, etc...be creative!  I would recommend going super easy, just 5min a day but everyday. Consistency is key and the hardest hurdle  Like working out, I don't really rely on motivation. I just do it. If you need a goal, try to do it for the whole year because that's when we are expecting the crypto bull cycle to run. Afterwards, you can reassess if you want to continue or not",30,1740437737.0,2025-02-24 22:55:37

1ixezyz,TheGDC33,"That is what matters, start somewhere that works well for you and build from that if you feel the urge and desire. It is your investment after all, so easy motivation",23,1740438975.0,2025-02-24 23:16:15
1ixezyz,p0tatemoon,"No worries! I forgot to also mentionned that any type of work is still work. If you only want to upvote on certik or coinmarketcap that's 100% work  Just like the other member responded, at the end of the day, it is your investment. You can give anything you want : no work at all, 5sec, 5 min, 5 hours, etc  To be honest with you, I was invested in Kendu for a couple of months but did zero work. When I saw the CTO happening and saw how the community got together, I wanted to be part of what makes Kendu so special : ""We don't gamble, we work"". I started with upvotes here and there. Noticed that I could do a bit more so I put a few minutes more  Just having you write here is great, glad to have you among us!",21,1740440766.0,2025-02-24 23:46:06
1ixezyz,MFSkunk17,"What keeps me going is the holder growth. Market conditions suck, tons of reputable (and non-reputable) memecoins are bleeding mc and holders. Their cores are losing conviction.   Kendu is the only one really holding strong. The tg is full of hundreds of chads and chadettes who believe in the cause for a slew of reasons too long to list here. Kendu holds strong because it's always been more than just hype and conviction. There's real passion and connection there you won't see anywhere else. Kendu won't rest until they are in the billions. You really feel that.",24,1740440468.0,2025-02-24 23:41:08

1ixezyz,insegniah1,"For me its the community still showing up every day, working and sticking to our goal.  Of course what is happening now is out of our control in terms of the market absolutely nuking.  During this I am seeing, Kendu has held up at the top of my memes watchlist on cmc almost daily.  Also, I have just browsed other communities subs out of curiousity, and the difference in vibes is day and night. Many communities are feeling the despair yet in Kendu the vibes are positive and energetic 24/7  Thats why I know this community is special  I myself am DCAing today :)",17,1740451095.0,2025-02-25 02:38:15
