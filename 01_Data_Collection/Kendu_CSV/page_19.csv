Kendu is not just a meme, it is becoming an established irl brand and movement.  we have actually people, building actual projects and movements irl and adding tangible value to Kendu.  i really recommend instead of spreading negativity to get more involved and recognize all of the potential that Kendu has, not just monetary.   in essence, don't be such a negative nancy :p",14,1740157365.0,2025-02-21 17:02:45

If someone paid attention to Kendu for the last few months, they will know that there were ups and downs in the community. That was the reference to the ""journey""  Some memecoins have a core value like an utility, making unique memes and some have nothing but the thumbnail on coingecko. Kendu's core value is ""We don't gamble, we work"". People who joined did it because they want to believe in it and do their part. People who don't believe in it just skip the project and continue scrolling  It is because a community member did their part / work that you notice Kendu and left a comment   Even in real life, we can't expect to do nothing and get rich unless we got lucky  I still hope that your investments do well this cycle and that you find the hidden gem that will make you rich",11,1740159807.0,2025-02-21 17:43:27

Possible that sol or base don’t have enough volume to pass some automatic test. onchain a lot of our volume is on ETH, but most volume is actually at CEXs.   Also, for many of those things you can pay to her officially listed as „safe“, unfortunately that is how crypto works. Has nothing to do with the actual safety of the investment or the crypto project.  That being said, Kendu is one of the few meme coins that has their team verified on certik and is rated in the top 20 of all memes (top 5% of all crypto) in the certik safety score.

1istfr9,[deleted],I have hopes for ETH doing well moving forward. I think ETH doing well is a good indicator. It hit that big dip and found its bottom and its been snaking up.   I think some other memecoins that are/were very popular are on their way to slow death.    Kendu.. Kendu will survive and flourish. I really feel this is the gauntlet month and what makes it through this will prove itself in the hottest flames,5,1739964487.0,2025-02-19 11:28:07

When they do, you'll see moves like the one to ATH, only this time we can go a lot higher and stay a lot higher due to better distribution, add more to the active army, and grow from there. The opportunity is immense, everyone just has to seize it.

1istfr9,p0tatemoon,"This is not a financial advice so take it with a grain of salt   In my opinion, the fact that we are investing in memecoins means that we should be aware of the possible consequences. It is a high risk high reward kind of investment   I invested in Kendu because of the motto ""We don't gamble, we work"", the effort of the community, the fact that it is also been audited + KYC / wormhole / CTO was also a bonus. Those are my criteria for this investment. If Kendu doesn't meet those criteria anymore then I have no reason to hold. For now, it is still going strong for me   I think you should ask yourself if Kendu still checks the things you believed in when you started to invest. It is easy to look at a chart of other coins and say ""If I sold at X, then bought at Y, I could have made a lot of money"".    The question would be : what is my next move? If I decide to sell X coin then I have to write down all the reasons to do so. If that coin goes up afterwards then I have no regret because I had all those arguments to sell. Make a plan and follow through",20,1739937822.0,2025-02-19 04:03:42

Yes, this trip down from ATH has sucked, but it's given me the opportunity to keep stacking my bags to a place I never thought possible.  I am kinda grateful for that tbh.",17,1739931587.0,2025-02-19 02:19:47

1istfr9,insegniah1,"Sure nothing is certain but thats where the whole “we dont gamble, we work” stems from  You work to maximise the chances of success  You work to turn the “luck” in to a reward  Maybe we have a nuclear war tomorrow and the market collapses  Assuming though we have the bull, eth hitting ATHs and an alt season like we are meant to ( we will ) then all strong communities in the space will succeed  Personally I have never seen a community like Kendu  It is just simply a matter of when in my mind, not if  In addition, “delusion” contributes to a coins success  If everyone thinks well this is a 20B dollar coin, then it is likely a 20B coin because well no one is selling until then  I myself am a realist in life. Realistically, this community is absolutely brilliant",7,1739950268.0,2025-02-19 07:31:08
1istfr9,Scuttlefuzz,"The market sucks, if we go lower it's because people who got in when KENDU launched are selling. It's not fun but these whales exiting their position at the bottom is better for all of us in the long run. Once the market turns around things will be very different and fewer early whales will mean less suppression when we go up.   But really, the market is ass right now. If you were to jump into anything it would be pure luck if it went up. The beauty of KENDU compared to other coins is that we have a community that sets it apart from everything else. Why would I gamble on some shit irrelevant meme when I could be in a project with the best community? I know where I'm betting my money...",4,1739973602.0,2025-02-19 14:00:02

1istfr9,p0tatemoon,"The ""work it and community stuff"" is the core of Kendu. I can understand that it is not for every type of investors  A bit like some coins that main purpose is having their artist create unique memes. Some people will decide to invest because they believe it will be popular and go viral. If a person doesn't like memes, why would they invest in that coin? Same thing with ""We don't gamble, we work""  As for another rug, Kendu has now been KYC verified so I believe it adds a layer of trust  At the end of the day we all have to keep in mind that memecoins are a high risk high reward investment. I know that I can get wrecked at anytime and I'm ready to face it  We always hear about people who made a lot of money off crypto but we don't often hear about the ones who lost. I'm glad that you were able to make profit and I hope all your investments skyrocket when the market turns green",3,1739973666.0,2025-02-19 14:01:06
