1irv83p,RegardedQt314,"Lorniko! an absolute legend in the community.  it's because of you that i got so involved with reddit side of Kendu and i will forever be appreciative of you for that.    your story definitely resonates with a lot of other holders including myself and i love the direction that we are headed now.  the vibes took a complete 180 since the cto event happened and it really feels like we are back on the right track.  i know the price action is not ideal, but we are in a really good position for when the market turns around.    we just need to keep grinding and spreading the word of Kendu.  even if you as a holder don't feel like you can or want to be a ""creator"" for Kendu, your word of mouth is equally important!  it is incredibly easy to support the project by using your own personal networks and connections to share and spread all of the initiatives and creations that others have done for the project.  everyone plays a role in this 🤝",31,1739829726.0,2025-02-17 22:02:06

1irv83p,YouKhanSeeMe,"I think a lot of people had a similar experience. The only reason to stick around for so long was the community, it’s truly something special.   It’s a relief to wake up everyday and not be in fear that the dev has done something to harm the project again. Seeing people regain their enthusiasm and faith is contagious and the amount of things being built is unparalleled.  A lot of successful projects have been through difficult times. Kendu has too much going on and too many people that love it to not be successful on a long enough timeline.   The fallout from Libra, Melania etc has opened a lot of eyes about how stacked the deck is against the average person chasing new launches. Conviction plays that are constantly building and growing are the only way for 99.9% of people to make money and I’m confident Kendu will capture a lot of the mindshare when market sentiment flips.",21,1739834753.0,2025-02-17 23:25:53

Thank you for sharing also as it does resonate with me the multitude of feelings that have gone thru my own head throughout this challenging journey. You have been there since I began my Kendu journey and you were one of the people I noticed less active and it was subconsciously alarming.

1iriupm,p0tatemoon,"It might not directly answer your question but I believe the strategy lies withing the community  You can have the best strategy to spread out the words about a project but without a community to take action, it will be difficult    Kendu strong point is how the community members all work together but also on their own. If someone like to play games, they can ad a Kendu tag to their name and that counts as work. We try to have real interaction/conversation whenever is possible   All those little work counts and adds up quickly  *We don't gamble, we work* that's the mentality when we decide to invest in Kendu. It's not like any other stock where we just put money and wait to see things go well for the company. We want to put a bit of our own effort. If Kendu succeed, it won't be because of one person but because of all of us",17,1739798687.0,2025-02-17 13:24:47

We already have pretty good engagement, on par or higher than pepe, wif, brett if you go by certik. And also here the community always does something:  * we have been really active on the billboard on base to make kendu art which has earned us a few shouts by the dev * we organize spaces on x regularly to talk about kendu and bring new people in * and we raid pretty much anyone we want, whether it’s a poll against UFD, PI and SPX, or to get a free article by clarissa yorke - our community shows up organically.

Please remember the rules here, we do not put ""Kendu"" and ""scam"" in the same sentence regardless of what your perceptions of the past are.  There are currently no plans for the Chads NFTs. They do not even display on popular marketplaces like Blur and Opensea, just a blank image, and even if the art did display it's low-quality and outdated. Even if we delivered an NFT marketplace, it would be dead on arrival. NFTs are not returning to their former 2021 glory, it will be old collections pumping on Blur and Opensea.

1iqisrg,ShMaCo33,"I bought a patch ""board"" which is basically a big piece of the soft part of the velcro, to display my collection. This whole idea started when I ordered a patch for my dog, and when it came, I laughed at the craftsmanship. I knew I could produce something of much higher quality, and so, Kendu Unstitched was born! You won't be disappointed!",10,1739677632.0,2025-02-16 03:47:12

1iqisrg,Liminal_Dogess,"A suggestion for how to attach them, you could possibly carefully sew a safety pin on the back to create a badge. 🙂   Edit: another idea is to sew a key chain to the back and then for security, stitch a sturdy fabric to the back to offer more security. If you have two patches, depending on symmetrical shape, you could stitch a separate patch onto the rear to keep the key chain in place. That way, you are always showing the logo regardless of the position of the keyring. You can buy loads of cheap keyring/key chains from eBay.
