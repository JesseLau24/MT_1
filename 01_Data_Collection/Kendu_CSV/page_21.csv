1iphjgx,Flashnewera11,It’s crazy if people do their “Due Diligence” on “DOGE”  since they sponsor even a NASCAR driver.  The founder did it for fun and as a joke yet was not aware it would go high and he sold early.  He regrets selling early.  The community brought it up.  Yes Elon Musk played a huge part of it because he helped it pumped up multiple times.  The community stayed strong.  Just like Shiba.  Kendu Inu is undervalued and one day it will just explode.  The community is active and the word just keeps spreading.  As long as there’s new holders everyday and eventually it will break through and go back up.  Then another one.  It’s under valued and should be over $3-5 Billion and no higher than $10 Billion on bad market.  Yet a lot of room to grow.,2,1739908660.0,2025-02-18 19:57:40

Focus on what is in your reach, on the things you can impact, the things you can change.  As one piece of advice, instead of shilling Kendu 24/7 online, go outside and take walk. Maybe print some kendu flyers that you can hand out and distribute IRL. Or go for a crypto/web3 event in your city. Plenty to find on eventbrite or meetup.

1iok0su,phi_curious,"Good question. First of all, I do agree that Kendu is for everyone and that the demographic is mixed (age, background, country etc), but there is probably still a bias towards the general crypto crowd: male, younger age, etc.  As for my approach, for placing them in random spots, I went to areas that are highly frequented and placed them somewhere where they will be touched and found by someone guaranteed, eg the credit card terminal on the last pic, or the phone holder in the second pic.  Let’s see how things go. Maybe one day when we asked a newcomer how they found us, they will send a picture of one of these cards.
