When buy volume is equal to sell volume MC doesn't move. Surely you can this guess what makes MC/price go up or down.

Alt season hasn‚Äôt started yet, we‚Äôre at the point where Wintermute have crashed something but BTC dominance hasn‚Äôt quite settled. It‚Äôs a great time to stack, but if you can‚Äôt stack the next best thing you can do is hodl and enjoy the ride.  Nobody has seen the kind of IRL presence Kendu has and continues to build, in crypto. The holder count goes up exponentially on the daily and we‚Äôre about to launch a website that makes it so much easier for the normies to get in. Then on-chain we‚Äôve got a Certik grade of A with KYC verification.

I wouldnt be surprised if BTC dominance never drops and the 'alt season' never comes to fruition. This isnt fud, its just telling you not to expect anything just because it happened twice before and was correlated.  Correlation is not causation so be wary. Kendu requires faith. Have it, or dont. Scared money dont make money. But dont blindly ape into anything in crypto.    What ive learned from crypto is that it is unpredictable.",11,1739311347.0,2025-02-11 22:02:27

I just got a new job, and though it pays a good bit better than my last, I get paid every two weeks which I‚Äôm not used to. I still have a bag, it‚Äôs just a little lighter.  When I‚Äôm more stable financially I‚Äôll be able to put in again every check. I‚Äôm beyond stoked for this project.  The analogy of the catapult and our efforts just tightening the strings is great. When alt season hits, we‚Äôre in for a fun ride! It‚Äôs definitely been interesting so far!",3,1739284156.0,2025-02-11 14:29:16

It‚Äôs not about the individual bags that we hold, but about the collective power of the community and what each individual can contribute to that.   Always make sure to make good, healthy and sustainable decisions with your money and don‚Äôt ape every thing into a meme.
