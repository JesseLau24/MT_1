1inou12,TheGDC33,First I would say we have very very little volume. Second to answer your question: look at the buys and sells from the three other pictures included. When buy volume is equal to sell volume MC doesn't move. Surely you can this guess what makes MC/price go up or down.   Volume is the total amount of buys and sells,8,1739371962.0,2025-02-12 14:52:42

1infu9p,kingkongbananakong,To be honest i don’t think the chads platform will launch… it’s a common trope for developers to always have something “ready to launch” to keep buyers engaged.

1imwcaw,CoopVelociraptor,"Short answer - Yes.  Go right ahead and check what the greatest runners of last bullrun were priced at this time in 2021. Alt season hasn’t started yet, we’re at the point where Wintermute have crashed something but BTC dominance hasn’t quite settled. It’s a great time to stack, but if you can’t stack the next best thing you can do is hodl and enjoy the ride.  Nobody has seen the kind of IRL presence Kendu has and continues to build, in crypto. The holder count goes up exponentially on the daily and we’re about to launch a website that makes it so much easier for the normies to get in. Then on-chain we’ve got a Certik grade of A with KYC verification. Not to mention, whatever chads &amp; chadettes decide they’re gonna do next from here - the thing carrying this project was and will always be us.

1imwcaw,[deleted],"Timing coincides with other peak times, but if you know about crypto, you know it cant be predicted.   I wouldnt be surprised if BTC dominance never drops and the 'alt season' never comes to fruition. This isnt fud, its just telling you not to expect anything just because it happened twice before and was correlated.  Correlation is not causation so be wary. Kendu requires faith. Have it, or dont. Scared money dont make money. But dont blindly ape into anything in crypto.    What ive learned from crypto is that it is unpredictable.",11,1739311347.0,2025-02-11 22:02:27
1imwcaw,CoopVelociraptor,"Agree - past performance is not necessarily an indicator of future success.   I’m mostly predicting alt season based on greed - as in there’s substantially more $ to be made by market makers and whales by rotating the $ rather than staying on BTC. Guaranteed, absolutely not… but it’s a fair bet to expect people who like making $ to want to make more $.   I’d be lying through my teeth tho if I said I knew WHEN it starts. We gonna have to wait and see all the same 😅🫡",7,1739317516.0,2025-02-11 23:45:16

It’s impossible to call the unknown as either bullish or bearish, we can only draw conclusions based on the elements we do know and at the end of the day it makes crypto in general an ultra high risk play.

I just got a new job, and though it pays a good bit better than my last, I get paid every two weeks which I’m not used to. I still have a bag, it’s just a little lighter.  When I’m more stable financially I’ll be able to put in again every check. I’m beyond stoked for this project.  The analogy of the catapult and our efforts just tightening the strings is great. When alt season hits, we’re in for a fun ride! It’s definitely been interesting so far!",3,1739284156.0,2025-02-11 14:29:16
1im7h1m,phi_curious,"Hey Jonny, I think many of us can relate. It’s not about the individual bags that we hold, but about the collective power of the community and what each individual can contribute to that.   Always make sure to make good, healthy and sustainable decisions with your money and don’t ape every thing into a meme.  Let’s just have fun and lets enjoy the slingshot ride ;)",2,1739286251.0,2025-02-11 15:04:11
