The community now is a lot bigger, in particular the actively working community. And it has been battle tested.

1ii7ajz,insegniah1,"The chart only tells one story fren.  You join the community and you see a side that you will likely embrace.  The chart also tells a story of our history, one with the Dev who we actively wrestled with as a community. The best way to view it now is after the CTO in where KOLs and influencers have returned, we have had a massive engagement and activity spike and all the OGs have returned.  We also have just formed a higher low.   The chart is bottomed out, alt season around the corner, with us now building very steadily and we have no hindrance anymore in regards to a dev.market just had a huge capitulation and leverage flush and we were chilling.  Decentralised communities are key. We are one now.  I understand your outlook of course but its in my opinion that now is probably the best time to get in that there ever will be.

1ii7ajz,kingkongbananakong,"I respect that. My initial plan was to wait until the best buy-in time but my conviction and Fomo got the best of me.  I think there are many many people like you who need to see certain levels reached before they buy. And there is nothing wrong with that strategy, Thats one of the reasons that when we will rise we will rise very fast.  Right now the entire market is waiting for the conditions to get a little better/stable, but I expect it to be back on track around next weekend",11,1738754159.0,2025-02-05 11:15:59
1ii7ajz,Potlimitcrypto,"The chart looks bad, granted. So too do most memecoin charts at the moment. Attached are Binance-listed projects in 2025 and their declines since listing. Everything has been decimated, and safe to say, Kendu with them for reasons of our own some of which can be attributed to the ex-dev selling and launching other tokens.  The metrics outside of chart/PA are in a state of growth. Community activity, sentiment, and drive is up only with the recent change and work will compound when there is more liquidity in the market to tap into.  We're not going to stop pushing Kendu, Kendu isn't going anywhere, and our output exceeds that of multi-billion dollar projects. There is only one way I can see Kendu going this cycle and that is very far upwards from where it is now.  So, you can buy when there's blood in the streets, or buy at higher prices. But outside of the chart that much of the market shares, other metrics are looking insanely good, and price catches up with those eventually.  In a pinned message in this sub you can listen to my recent interview with crypto Rich about Kendu's path to growth at scale.  I can assure you that Kendu is very much alive and the future is bright.  All the best!  https://preview.redd.it/6xt28t54rbhe1.jpeg?width=595&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b2ef2985dcc9b52392a30b4676bb4b9097e8e39",20,1738763009.0,2025-02-05 13:43:29

1ii7ajz,DonDengue,You have to remember for people that scroll you planted in their head Kendu is dead  If I’m hunting for a token I look for the headline to see who is active.

Also, there the probability that it goes to 0 is the same as it goes up. You can have a strong community without having a coin - so where is the benefit?

1ih3fl3,kingkongbananakong,Because we’re next up. Saying we’re dead is like saying we already had a run but we have never had a run. The big spike you see on the left of the chart was done in a few days with 0 community and made look way bigger than it was due to 1 order from someone with the wrong settings for his spread.   This is what all charts of major breakout coins like the big meme coins looked like before breakout.   So people start looking for the next meme coin that will break out this cycle and for that you can’t look at price because all major project had big downward trends before breaking out. What happens behind the scenes in those downward trends is key here. As many coins as possible need to get distributed to real believers.  Me and many other holders know that Kendu can rise to 10-20b like the other coins easily. If many holders have that same conviction eventually it will turn out true. Because the people holding the token get to decide when to sell it.   If you bought earlier into Kendu way more people had lower sell targets thus was it way harder to climb the charts.   https://www.armchairbanker.com/will-kendu-inu-increase-1447-and-other-memecoins-to-explode-in-2025/,2,1738751825.0,2025-02-05 10:37:05

1ign3yc,TheGDC33,Yeah I assume we need to see BTC make a sizeable move and then it could be time to trickle down to alts then memes. Not sure how long we may have to wait though,15,1738583966.0,2025-02-03 11:59:26
1ign3yc,Barnickal,"If it's years, then so be it. I had to remind myself yesterday that when I got into Crypto, it was with the intention of holding for a decade or so. We get so excited over pumps, but we're here for the longrun!",11,1738586424.0,2025-02-03 12:40:24
1ign3yc,TheGDC33,"Fair. I will say I envisioned myself holding no more crypto after this cycle and waiting for the bear to load up again. Have some old dinosaur coins from 2017 that still do move and have great tech, but hype is gone and they are just good business. Ready to cash those out. We will see what is what by end of this or next week I assume. But I do really know shit about fuck😂",8,1738586995.0,2025-02-03 12:49:55

1ign3yc,Dramatic_Weakness693,What does the fractional holders chart mean? I see it moves in increments of .1?,6,1738603254.0,2025-02-03 17:20:54
1ign3yc,TheGDC33,It is just a silly thing the bot did to make a graph. Really went down 1 holder and then up 1 holder in a day. Bot made the graph look dramatic. In both metrics bots that Kendu has used they adjust the y-axis depending on holder growth.,7,1738603581.0,2025-02-03 17:26:21
1ign3yc,Dramatic_Weakness693,Gotcha! So we’ve had sell volume but it doesn’t seem like the holders are dumping all their bags?,6,1738611989.0,2025-02-03 19:46:29
1ign3yc,TheGDC33,"We did lose almost 60 holders since the end of January. We still have just shy of 17,500 holders. There are definitely people who are capitulating as I doubt it is wells and those with conviction. My assumption is that is a reaction to the market conditions and world events and just things that would shake anyone out. Yes, I would agree. It doesn't seem like the holders are dumping all their bags. Ethereum also went down a lot and that definitely impacts price. We were over 4,000 on ethereum when we hit our last all-time high",5,1738613466.0,2025-02-03 20:11:06
