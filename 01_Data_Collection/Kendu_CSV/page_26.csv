And has been so far.   Popcat down to 250m from 2b, Moodeng down to 90m from 800m, Chillguy down to 44m from 750m. All in the last couple of months. So if you’re feeling the pain, know that it’s shared.   The market is scuffed but community wins in the end and Kendu is #1. We won’t stop building and onboarding and I believe we have a lot more time to do that than people realise.   We will take Kendu to billions.   The competition for social output has been washed, so let’s continue to dominate on all fronts.  Much love to you Kendu guys and gals. You’re the finest. 🫡",37,1738543818.0,2025-02-03 00:50:18

1igcn2w,p0tatemoon,"Thank you for you input   I agree, it is down a lot from ATH. Mainly due to the sell pressure of the old dev and holders did jump ship because of his actions. Those left are the people who still believe in Kendu. Are we wrong or right to do so, it could be the new Eldorado like you mentionned or it could be the 10th level of hell, only time will tell. One thing I know is that the community is not going to stop working  Since then, Kendu has ""CTO""ed and taken a new direction. The fundamentals remain the same. This is a coin with an emphasis on the community and spreading the words through the members. With Kendu being on ETH, SOL wormhol and coming to base, it keeps building even in the red market  Also the last 3 months has been pretty harsh to alts/memecoins. If you look at PEPE and other big memecoins, they all took a hit and so did Kendu  Let's not forget that this is a memecoin, it is a high risk high reward type of coin. Always DYOR, don't feel pressured to buy if it doesn't check all the criteria you are looking for  Wishing you the best with your investments and may you be blessed with green candles!

Without starting with 100,000 when you are losing 10-100% on fees.   ETH will have its little Pump this year. But marky words. ETH will dissolve in 3 years if they don't dramatically reduce fees. There are MANY other options now. Unlike 10 years ago.  ETH Literally hasn't even tried to reduce fees or improve the system in the last 5-10 years.",1,1738596899.0,2025-02-03 15:34:59
