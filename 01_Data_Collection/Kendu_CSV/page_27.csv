1iexzyz,ksgr8,"I bought SOL with fiat on Binance P2P. Then transferred them to my Phantom wallet. Used it to swap with Kendu. Be sure to check the contract address before swapping.  How do you end up getting less than it's worth? - P2P demands more price than current market price - Gas fee to transfer the SOL to wallet - Slippage when swapping 🥲  Let me know if you can find a better way.  Edit: Why I had to use Binance P2P -&gt; when fiat is INR, you don't have much options. The CEXs in India don't allow Crypto withdrawals, so the only option is P2P via Binance or scammy platforms like Onramp.",6,1738383011.0,2025-02-01 04:10:11
