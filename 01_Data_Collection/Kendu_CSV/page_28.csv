1id2nmp,Potlimitcrypto,"Price went from 6m-34m in like 48h with news of the CTO. There will be profit takers after a move like that and the onchain market is completely scuffed. I pinned a post in the Telegram which read something like this:  ""Don't worry about ""trending"" now, onchain market is dead with just random narratives running a bit on Sol and fuck all else happening. The #1 priority now is getting F&amp;F networks and extended networks into Kendu. Word of mouth conversions are much more important than X presence right now.  No-one is degenning outside of narratives on Sol. Our efforts are best placed in:  - IRL networks/events/friends and family* - Presence on popular Spaces - Threads - EARLY high viewership X posts (Don't bother with old posts at all)  In that order of importance.""  You can't beat the market, there is none or very little volume Kendu can tap into. But we can gradually build our floor in a market like this in time for the next leg, so that's what we should focus on doing. It's not going to randomly pump to 60m when there is nothing happening onchain.  We're in a market where even Pepe got cut in half. All longs liquidated across thousands of projects and tens upon tens of billions wiped out. It's been a bloodbath. Kendu is holding up very well considering.  Try not to focus on the day to day and instead focus on where we want to be in six months.",1,1738200753.0,2025-01-30 01:32:33

1id2nmp,insegniah1,"The ONLY thing holding us back is now gone my fren.  I understand and honestly shared similar feelings under Geoff.  Many of us feeling left demotivated or like we were pushing against a brick wall. In hindsight the slow bleed was obvious but its hard to see during the midst of it. He actively worked to create a bad image and to drive away investors, which is why we needed the CTO.  So.. the CTO has happened, supply returned, no more negative imagery on behalf of Kendu. A clean slate.  The absolute only thing holding us back has now left, and we are in the hands of the community.  I genuinely feel so much more motivated again now knowing we can reap the rewards of our efforts with no hindrance.  Im not sure you are in the TG but if you arent you would have seen so so many countless OGs returning. We have KOLs calling us out again for free because they love the community, a 300% jump immediately following the news.  We have now a Kendu we can proudly shill and represent. We have experienced a redistribution period like no other and there is nothing but blue skies ahead.  If there was ever a time where working would be the most beneficial, that time is now.

And at one point you were ready but decided to kill your conviction chasing the odd green candle. Then the bull leaves without you.  Meme coins need people who have disposable income or profits from other coins to flourish.   Life is tough. Crypto is tough.  The hands with cash are not asking ‚Äú why down‚Äù.. they are just doing their thing and will ape when the time is right.  In a token that has been around a year there are only so many ‚Äú family and friends‚Äù you can sell to..  All they are hearing is BTC hitting ATH and Trump Family Grift rugging Solana.

1id11u3,Potlimitcrypto,"Sounds great in theory but it's a terrible idea in practice. Kendu is a memecoin/brand, it is not a DAO. I have several hundred bad ideas in my DMs at any given time. If we have to vote on them all, we will see our first changes in 2028.  If they are not binding and I can still steer away from the nice-sounding but bad ideas that come my way, and trust me, there are a lot of them, then it will just lead to upset when I say no to an idea that will waste resources and time but the community votes ""yes"" on.  Also, adding this onchain complexity is something very, very, very few people care about. You are a dev, some people are crypto native, but our target audience are NOT technically minded at all. Having snapshot makes Kendu more complex and less attractive. I have extensive experience with DAOs and I can tell you that very few work out as intended. Someone has to steer the ship and make decisions. My vision for Kendu is to move away from onchain and break into the real world with products and services, because this is the best path to growth on the scale we want to achieve, like Pudgy Penguins, and sellotaping a non-binding DAO governance vote on Kendu when that's what we're working towards makes no sense.   If you want to do this, there is nothing stopping you from getting a private group of Kendu holders together, pooling some resources, and then voting on how you should use them or what you should focus on. Assemble a DAO strike force for Kendu and see how it goes.

While that can be the case I would think for the community leaders it would be weight from their shoulders as well when you can sign crucial topics up for vote and there is no decision per se you as an individual need to make and be held accountable for.  With such an active community I would think the turnout to vote will be quite good.

1iccta6,Leafan1976,That's what I'm thinking too. The upside on Kendu has much more potential.   I am almost certain ETH based coins will see a big influx of cash. As ETH hits ATHs  I know Kendu is a bad ass community that's always pushing hard. Coinbase also steers newbies towards Kendu and Pepe yes.... But it's still going to pay off more for Kendu too ....  PEPE lost like 50% of it's MC over the last couple drops. Seems like they will struggle to recover that drop. Considering that 50% is Billions. We just need to Convince all the people sitting on a bag of PEPE that's down 50% to take the loss and flip what's left into Kendu and we will all recover FAST !!!

Maybe you are a new holder, maybe you are a long time holder but someone who has kept on the sidelines, maybe you think that your contribution may not help.  I found Kendu back in may / June and have been here since. I was inducted in to the culture of work and spreading the word and now I find myself today as a loyalist in the TG.  Did I know this was going to happen or that I was working with the aim of achieving that role? Absolutely never did I see that coming.  I saw others working, their enthusiasm, sending in links and showing off different IRL achievements that they had completed in the name of spreading Kendu and that motivated me.  I wanted to help too.  I realised quickly that even though I am by no means a whale, somebody with important crypto connections or just somebody with any kind of pull, I can still contribute to Kendu in massive ways.  I utilise X, reddit, stocktwits, etc. I tell my friends about it, I DM people about it, i make conversations with strangers about it. I do everything within my power.  My point is that you dont need to be ‚Äúsomebody‚Äù to help.  We are all equally important in the story of pushing Kendu global, and that is the truth.  We all have the power to make this a worldwide movement, the ability to utilise our unique networks and skills.  Kendu is our canvas and we all should use it to paint our wildest dreams, using it as a vehicle of opportunity.  It is up to each and every one of us to put this in the billions.
