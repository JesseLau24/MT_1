1iblazl,RegardedQt314,for anyone interested i highly recommend not doing a swap outside of an established NFT marketplace.  you can list your chads on Opensea and this is where everyone should be conducting their transactions.  1 on 1 trades is a sure fire way to get scammed.,1,1738018942.0,2025-01-27 23:02:22

1ib7zpx,phi_curious,"Also remember that we are currently raising funds to make a base wormhole. You can buy Kendu over the counter (ie directly from Josh).  I post his message from earlier today below:  Team,   I will now formally begin OTCing $KENDU to fund the Base LP. We need to raise $50k and by OTCing the Kendu chart isn’t affected. Eth and major stables will be accepted, no other tokens.  The process:   1) You will DM me with the amount you want to buy. 2) You will send that amount to the crowdfund wallet address: 0xD22849fcB4C83389E65a1c40748a9b67157638A3 3) You will share the TX hash with me.  4) I will return the same value in $KENDU to an address you specify in DMs.  Do not begin sending without first arranging with me in DM.  Personally, I think this dark market period is perfect to get this cycle building block in place, so let’s run it up!",8,1737990583.0,2025-01-27 15:09:43
1ib7zpx,HamsterDunce,"Yessir. NFA but I think the dump in majors right now is a bullish correction to give some US players an entry.   As far as Kendu goes, dca’ing on dips is a must. Not only to lower your cost basis if you had bought in higher, but also to keep transferring tokens to the believers. The real pumps happen once we have enough of the supply in our hands.",5,1737989623.0,2025-01-27 14:53:43

1ib7zpx,insegniah1,"DCA and work, my friend!  You actually offset your breakeven point by DCAing and Kendu is bottomed out, with only upside for this coming alt season.  We also control our destiny and the outcome of Kendu through our work.  We all have the power to determine how far in to the billions we go by onboarding our networks and utilising our unique networks and talents to push the name as far as possible.  We dont gamble, we work!",5,1738011569.0,2025-01-27 20:59:29
1ib7zpx,Seanonethree,"I totally feel ya on this. Down $5K on 110M Kendu here. But after the recent events and how what we all perceive as the bottom finally being in, DCA’ing at this low point would be beneficial to us both at this stage if we were just trying to break even. While breaking even is not my plan, I think all signs point to some green candles in the not too distant future. Nothing is promised but things have clearly been coming around in a much more positive way for this great community.",2,1738024968.0,2025-01-28 00:42:48
