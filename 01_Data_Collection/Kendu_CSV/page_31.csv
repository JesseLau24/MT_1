1i9amjq,[deleted],Someone in TG was talking about another memecoin that did the exact same thing but it failed. However when the coin took off the NFTs became valuable and are now worth 1 ETH each.

1i97s7r,PrestigiousAd9825,"Price was going downhill for over 6 months as Miazaki started launching projects and ideas that were not in line with the original group goals/unpopular with a large chunk of holders.   Any complaints/tough questions would be banned or scrutinized, and this chronic sell pressure took about 90% of the value out of the coin.   People did some digging and realized Miazaki’s story about these new projects and his holdings didn’t add up - critics of Kendu started spamming about this on CMC and other online spaces.   While this happened, Miazaki got even more dismissive and unhinged, to the point where it started getting legitimately awkward and difficult to contain FUD.   Then, it was announced he would be stepping down from leadership to focus on developing Chads. After this, he snapped and started talking shit about Kendu on social media while dumping his bags.  In response, he got legit doxxed and it became public knowledge that he lied about his age, wealth, connections to Shib, and usage of Kendu funds - with some speculating that he used it to support gambling/drug addictions (no clue how much of this was true but it would explain him being broke).   He was working with Josh to hand off the Telegram, but went rogue and said he wouldn’t be leaving because “Kendu would be nothing without him” or whatever. People threatened to sue/report him to tax authorities for fraud if he didn’t burn his coins, and mysteriously the price tripled in one day of trading, at a time where literally every other coin in the meme space was down HEAVILY.   To my knowledge we no longer have any ties with him, he’s deleted all of his socials and is hiding offline rn, and if he’s still holding any Kendu we aren’t aware of how much or what his wallet address is anymore.   He’s a ghost now. And the community has never felt better for it - vibes are insanely good. We also have a new Telegram chat bc he tried seizing the old one obvi",67,1737758345.0,2025-01-24 22:39:05

1i97s7r,Environmental_Set_49,"So many ways to tell a story…   In the spring of 2024 good animals from all around the kingdom were drawn to the Kendu forest because of its community atmosphere and the way it encouraged everyone to be the very best version of themselves. A wild but enthusiastic wolf welcomed them in and showed them around. There was so much possibility and creativity. The space brimmed with sunshine and the sounds of the Forrest animals hard at work.  However, in time it slowly became more obvious that something was amiss. The wolf that claimed to be in charge of the space turned out not to be as genuine and community-oriented as he’d led the other animals to believe. It was hard to believe. Could his intentions actually be malicious? At first it was just a small cloud hanging overhead but day by day the sky grew darker.  Animals that questioned him were ex-communicated from the Forrest under the logic that FUD brings down the whole community. The truth in this made it all the more confusing for the animals that remained. Where was the line of FUDing one’s bags and asking healthy and reasonable questions? The animals kept working and encouraging each other but the sky grew darker.  Until one day, the wolf went too far, everyone started to see the same thing at the same time and began to call out, “Kendu is community!” It was to become our rallying cry and the common value that would move us forward. Those who were already leaders among us rose up, took charge, and with strength, grace, and an unflinching vision lead us through CTO and into a clearing, where the clouds had begun to part, and a beautiful beam of sunlight poured down onto all the different Forrest animals, illuminating the values of mutual support and community that had kept us all there through the darkest days.  Over the following days the sky cleared and soft fluffy white clouds passed by on a bright blue sky. Animals that had left began to come back and everyone got to work sweeping up winter’s fallen leaves and getting ready for a bright and verdant early spring. The energy was infectious, everyone was more excited than ever to get to work building a brand new world.",2,1737956158.0,2025-01-27 05:35:58

1i8p2em,RegardedQt314,"i think the best case scenario will be that as the Kendu token rises in price, the chad NFTs will also grow in value simply due to the lore connecting the two.  as far as the promise of getting rewards based off fees from trading on the platform, i would just accept the reality that it won't happen.  a silver lining is that some of the funds from the chads mint is in the treasury now so at least we can actually utilize some of it for growing Kendu.   like the post outlines, miazaki has ownership of the domain, contract, and royalties so it is out of our hands unfortunately.",28,1737701031.0,2025-01-24 06:43:51
1i8p2em,Vegas_42,"Top 50 holder here. Thought a lot about this. One option going forward is to get in contact with Geoff/Miazaki and ask him to launch the platform. He stated it is ready to launch and he's going to continue working on it. While the state of the launch is most probably not true, he might have a self-interest in launching the platform. He holds 1100 chads and he is in desperate need of passive income to fund his ""lifestyle"". Very sad, but that's how I see it.  If he's not doing it, we should bring to his mind, that it's questionable but maybe (big maybe) not punishable to dump KENDU on the community. Whereas selling NFTs as parts of a company/platform with the promise of passive earnings and intentionally not delivering is fraud and surely will give him jail-time. To quote him: gloves are off. We should force him and make crystal clear that we will not accept a ""fake"" platform which is unsuccessfull from the beginning due to lack of engagement. He took millions of $ from investors and is obliged to deliver.  Finally, we should figure out a coordinated way to enforce this. It would be great to have support from the leadership team since appr. 1000 chads are affected.  Edit: to make this clear: chads is not going to be part of KENDU in the future as stated in the initial post. Only chad holders getting what they paid for - earning ETH from fees.",16,1737702943.0,2025-01-24 07:15:43
1i8p2em,TheGDC33,I wouldn't even trust him for me to be able to connect my wallet to that platform anymore and I double-checked to make sure my wallet was not connected anymore. Even if he could develop it. He is unfortunate that it is just gone and I will say for myself that I want nothing to do with that,10,1737720975.0,2025-01-24 12:16:15
1i8p2em,Potlimitcrypto,"Personally think distancing from Miazaki and his initiatives is the best move... It's the same reason that there is no association with Mega, Anarchy, Bueno, Freak and any other shitcoins they launched.  If he delivered Chads and it was subpar, which has a 99% probability, then it's a bad look for us. If he comes back to do it it's an even worse look.",17,1737709726.0,2025-01-24 09:08:46
1i8p2em,toosadtotell,"It was all a lie from Miazaki. The platform is not even built he was just saying this to keep people hooked. Do you know how much expertise and dollar it requires to build a NFT platform that can compete with major NFT players ?

1i8gaxb,Scuttlefuzz,He 100% did but the fact that he was dumping from a doxed wallet makes me think he unloaded those ones pretty early.,2,1737745863.0,2025-01-24 19:11:03
1i8gaxb,W-D-Goldbeard,"Aye tis great to be free o' thos shackles. Let us remember to keep up the positivity 'nd hard work 🪖  In just a few days thins have gone parabolic, we are on the right track. 💯 Billion will come in a flash 🙏🐶🙏",4,1737700467.0,2025-01-24 06:34:27
1i8gaxb,flyflex1985,"Not only that but with the amount of fear over the last few months, most people who already wanted out are out already so it’s much easier for the chart to climb",4,1737737043.0,2025-01-24 16:44:03
1i8gaxb,Scuttlefuzz,That is a good point. There will definitely be people who jump off once we reach their average but I think for the most part everyone who has stayed has as much conviction as ever,3,1737745930.0,2025-01-24 19:12:10
1i8gaxb,Scuttlefuzz,"Lol yeah... Guess that's what happens when some bum gets handed a large chunk of the supply. It's hard to say where we'd be now if it weren't for Chad's.   That caused a lot of big players to dip out and, rightfully so, stopped new big players from entering.   It's weird seeing the chart move like this, like the market is actually making decisions and it doesn't all hinge on when some junkie needs his next fix.   Anyways, glad that's all behind us now. We've been in a pressure cooker for a long time now. Our first run up was epic, hoping to see that the encore makes that run look like chump change",3,1737745772.0,2025-01-24 19:09:32
1i8gaxb,SeparateDonkey8843,"&gt;Lol yeah... Guess that's what happens when some bum gets handed a large chunk of the supply. It's hard to say where we'd be now if it weren't for Chad's.  Dont even... Ive thought about that a lot too. Its just so stupid of him, like if youre planning on extracting cash from your project and you have this good of a community, why not actually make it reach billions so you can take out more money for less coins?? Then it wouldnt even look sus",2,1737749689.0,2025-01-24 20:14:49
1i8gaxb,Scuttlefuzz,"The answer is drugs. He was different back in May when I got in, he was definitely planning on lying about everything, that much is clear, but he wasn't totally unhinged. Anyways, glad he's out, for all of our sakes.  The community proved itself through all of this. If people are investing in communities then I think we are as real as it gets.",3,1737752354.0,2025-01-24 20:59:14
1i8gaxb,SeparateDonkey8843,"Shame, because we was undoubtedly talented at making a community but just turned out to be a scammer",2,1737752682.0,2025-01-24 21:04:42
1i8jaau,phi_curious,"Yes, there is a new group: https://t.me/KenduInu_CTO  The old was locked during the CTO and is in the process of getting handed over to us.  Edit: also I can relate to you, felt exactly the same way about it!",22,1737681259.0,2025-01-24 01:14:19
