I’m grabbing lunch with a few people when I get home after the SuperBowl and hopefully I can get them on board with this now being a community-driven investment.  Been a while since I hit a bar and bought drinks for everyone holding Kendu… not really any good bars around here but I’ll get back onto that quest when I get home.  I’ll get amongst Threads, but my last glance said it was full of neck-bearded XRP dads 😂 Funny story, I was so popular in school that only this guy named Tom ever added me on MySpace. This scary alt girl made me add her on bebo tho… yeah actually ima go reconnect with her.

1i7xtq8,cryptosader,"xrp boomers are the best target audience imo , they got connections and being all in xrp they are not really in touch with memecoins or the crypto market in general so im confident they will be easily swayed into diversifying a bit , 1 blue chip coin (xrp) and a meme/moonshot coin (kendu) would be a cool strategy to them if the idea is sold correctly to them",5,1737636128.0,2025-01-23 12:42:08
1i7xtq8,CoopVelociraptor,"Maybe, my experience with them is they aren’t in-touch because they don’t usually take memecoins seriously at all though.   To your point, a strat can be well-explained.

1i7xtq8,phi_curious,"Thanks for the info champ. I’m a social media noob for the most part, since you mention threads, whatabout other platforms that gained significant traction recently?  I have no idea how crypto and in particular meme coins are perceived in those, so just throwing out names: bluesky, nostr, rednote/XHS?",13,1737626455.0,2025-01-23 10:00:55
1i7xtq8,cryptosader,"i don't think the userbase of bluesky is too fond of crypto in general tbh, rednote/xhs is a gold mine ready to get explored though because the chinese are notorious big pocketed whales , we need a chinese community asap(including weibo and other chinese socials) south koreans are also big crypto lovers/spenders to thats a good market to spread too",7,1737635942.0,2025-01-23 12:39:02
1i7xtq8,phi_curious,"That was my thought too about bluesky, without ever having been on the platform. Not sure if I know anybody in the chinese crypto space. But yes, agreed we need a strong presence in those other markets. Do you know if there is a chinese kendu inu telegram?",3,1737636111.0,2025-01-23 12:41:51
1i7xtq8,cryptosader,"no i dont know sorry , but the people don't necessarily need to be chinese at first just need to have good knowledge of chinese language so to help us spread into the chinese spaces and recruit as many people as possible",5,1737636480.0,2025-01-23 12:48:00

1i7zglh,phi_curious,Love the idea as well! I have some distantly related idea about music. We could release all the songs that we have created (and will create) to spotify under one Kendu Inu artist. I have published songs before so it’s definitely feasible.  If we listen to those playlists hard our artist will get paid by spotify etc for every stream. This money will then be used to buy Kendu and go into community wallet.  Maybe someone will see this and have input? I’ll make a separate Reddit post later.,10,1737633559.0,2025-01-23 11:59:19
