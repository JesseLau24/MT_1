1i7noa5,tokenKDN,"Very honest and humble - one commitment in the CTO is that we all move on and forget the life under the old regime. Emotions were understandably high and I think it is fair to say that most in the community, particularly the longer term holders, were under huge stress. It also shows the strength of the community with the DM you received offering warmth and reconciliation over retaliation, thats what Kendu is all about!

1i7noa5,According_Smell_5688,Don’t be so hard on yourself. Acknowledging your actions and taking responsibility is more than most people can muster. I entered the old TG a few months ago planning to “save” the community that I knew was still below the surface. I couldn’t believe the comments still backing miazaki despite the performance of the coin.   I felt that the community were sheep waiting to be fed on more by the wolf. I should have respected everyone’s perspective independent of my own. I was muted rather quickly as Kevin F. told me to just stop. He didn’t tell me I was out of line or that I was being aggressive. Just stop. I should have. I should have had more faith in all of you. I’m sure we’ve lost some for good but that’s ok.   Onward and upward my friends. I’m happy to see the community that I saw for the first time in May of last year. NOW it’s time for monogram bathrobes and martinis. Cheers.,2,1737724785.0,2025-01-24 13:19:45

1i77usl,HamsterDunce,"Yeah to that point I think there is no shame in admitting we all messed up. I’m not privy to all the details and the timeline, but it does feel like this move should have been made earlier.

1i77usl,phi_curious,"I have definitely seen many people sharing a similar sentiment. To me self-reflection is such an important part of the process of implementing a larger change (whether in personal life, professional, etc).

I knew what I was doing. I felt like it had to be done and I hope you and everyone else in the community understands at this point.  I tried more than once and was met with grace and respect, even as I spread FUD. My target was meant to be KM, not anyone else, for anyone reading this.  This is gonna be a moment you can all look back on and pat yourself on the back for. Standing up against whats wrong isnt easy. But, you all did it. With your bags on the line with an uncertain future.  Integrity is something not found frequently in the memecoin world. Lets face it, memecoins can be a fucking cesspool. That doesnt mean that you, I, we... shall I say us (I rejoined this week. Hi everyone, missed you guys) have to just live with it.  Have your voice heard. Dont be afraid to speak up.

1i77usl,Potlimitcrypto,"Roadmaps are the death of memecoins, they only exist to create sell the news events. There will never be a Kendu roadmap, everyone will be working autonomously on hundreds of things all the time. However, I am writing a whitepaper of sorts that will go into vision of the future/culture for growth and success/opportunity of Kendu.  The team are the Loyalists, most of whom have worked tirelessly on the project for six months or more. The team is also you, the community, and your continuous efforts. The change we needed was Miazaki leaving, if you've had your ear to the ground you would have witnessed the complete insanity that led to a lack of faith/selloff in the project.  I have ran projects and built communities, my role has been business development and community management, in fact, some of the active mods we have like Mike (Kendu Energy) and Kojak (Community updates) have followed me from a previous project. I've raised VC capital in the harshest of market conditions and negotiated significant deals. I've been headhunted by large Arrington Capital-backed Polkadot ecosystem projects and my work has been noticed by people at Yearn Finance and Sushi swap.   There are no skeletons in my closet and I've never launched a memecoin. While I've never single-handedly taken a project to multi-billions from nothing, we must remember too that before Shib, Shytoshi was just a holder begging for a toadswap airdrop, and I believe I'm coming from a far better position than that with much more experience under my belt.   I have proven myself over the last 11 months, and how much I care about the community. I've showed up every single day without a single day off... But most importantly, I'm a good person who cares about the lives of people around him.   Now that I'm in the driver's seat you can rest assured that there will be no other token launches, drunken hateful speeches, bad product launches, egregious dumping on the chart, blatant incompetency, and so on that will harm and scare away investment.  My vision for Kendu will be available in the whitepaper.",60,1737545348.0,2025-01-22 11:29:08

In the last few weeks the situation has become more and more complicated and my concerns about it have become greater and greater. But now after this turnaround brought about by this great community, I am completely calm and full of excited anticipation for everything that may come next! I thank you for your way of communicating things openly, fairly, calmly and clearly and yet always with a dose of humor. It is exactly what it needs internally and externally. clear words that are followed by clear actions. Just reliability.

They have tried gamifying it and different approaches, but the truth is it's cumbersome and boring. Kendu needs to be agile and nimble, we need to be able to act fast.

1i7qc25,litecoiner,"That term was co-opted by the communists, in fact they invented it in 1932 (IIRC), the German communist party, while it was under Stalin's rule. Maybe say pro-democracy, unless you truly are a communist, because otherwise many won't get behind it. Sorry for the historic note",1,1737629784.0,2025-01-23 10:56:24
1i7qc25,Vegas_42,"You're right from a historical point of view. The social discourse over the last 90 years adapted this expression in today's language as something against nazis, faschism of all kind and discrimination in general. It's not associated with being a communist today. From a sociological pov it's fine to use ""anti-fascist"" in a context of opposition to nazis without the conotation of being a communist. Sorry for the sociological note.  Sometimes anti-social, always anti-fascist!😎",1,1737631520.0,2025-01-23 11:25:20

1i77bcr,zeus109,"I am with you on that one, it's not like we getting money from heaven just to invest in anything and everything. Most of us have really put some blood, tears and sweat into this. Even got people we care so much about into this. To see that guy change dramatically with nonsense talk wich did not make any sense or contribute to anything really pissed me off. I think we are at the perfect time before the bull run really takes off and I hope we will all gonna make it.",14,1737539824.0,2025-01-22 09:57:04
1i77bcr,Jonnymixinupmedicine,"Hell yeah man. It bothers me that I fell for the Miazaki hype, but tbh I’ve been unhappy with the direction since he created Bueno. I think we’re still early. The bull run hasn’t quite gone crazy, but I am worried enough people will get burned with the Trump coin to go back into crypto. Worse, unneeded regulation that may follow.",12,1737540197.0,2025-01-22 10:03:17
1i77bcr,[deleted],"Im in construction too and when I look back at how much money I lost in Kendu, I get flashbacks of all those days that I was out in the hot sun climbing sand dunes building beach stairs. All that money I earned in 2023 completely gone in 2024.  But, theres always more opportunities ahead. Glad youre here.",9,1737550345.0,2025-01-22 12:52:25
1i77bcr,Jonnymixinupmedicine,"I’ve been here since early may. I very unfortunate had to self half my bag to pay for bills right before the run up. It sucks, but it is what it is.   We move on, we continue to build, and I don’t think there is anything stopping us on this point.  It would be pretty funny if some of us job site guys gave Geoff a visit so he can see what real Chad’s look like. Those of us that held, voted, shilled IRL, did TG raids. Anybody who knows a hard days work is a  Chad to me, and there some unchad like guys in construction too, but I can confidently say I don’t look like 5 pounds of shit shoved into a 1 pound bag like our past developer.",7,1737551179.0,2025-01-22 13:06:19
1i77bcr,[deleted],Hahahaha dude Im laughing at that last line.   Same thing happened to me. Had my taxes on extension and the time finally came where I had to pay the big bill... paid it and then all I had left was Kendu to my name and Kendu cant pay the rent.  Im glad to be back in at this low of a price. I remember my first buy was like 10x this price.  We got new ATH's to achieve!,7,1737551422.0,2025-01-22 13:10:22
