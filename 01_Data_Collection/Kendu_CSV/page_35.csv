1i6k229,lemond4455,"Thanks for pinging me. Your suspicion is correct in that building something like the Chads marketplace, *in a form that is actually competitive*, is a herculean task. Given this, and all the things about Miazaki that has recently come to light, like his unwillingness to follow through on even paying the winners of meme competitions, my current thinking is that it's highly unlikely that any significant work has gone into the marketplace and it's not just a matter of ""waiting for the right market conditions to release"", like he claims.   What he's actually planning to do with the Chads marketplace going forward is anyone's guess, but obviously his wider pattern is not reassuring. The one silver-lining is that the standard of NFTs that were used (ERC-721) opens the door for the development a different Chads marketplace without any major technical hurdles in implementing the sort of revenue-sharing for NFT holders that he had initially outlined.       I would be certainly be open to the possibly of helping develop such a marketplace, but I think right now the dust hasn't even settled for all the events that have occurred in the last week (Miazaki is trying to force himself back into the project?) so it would be too early to say.",7,1737495748.0,2025-01-21 21:42:28
