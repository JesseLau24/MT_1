1i60gzw,OtherwiseAd4239,Luckily he‚Äôs only got about 1.5% of the supply left in his wallets. There‚Äôs other whales with bigger wallets and they‚Äôre holding strong. Soon enough his selling won‚Äôt affect shit.,2,1737419824.0,2025-01-21 00:37:04
1i60gzw,RegardedQt314,"that's what i've been hearing as well in terms of his supply.  however i wouldnt expect price to just start ramping up immediately after he's done, because im sure a lot of outsiders looking in are trying to see how the dust will settle and what exactly has transpired.  i think it's important to be clear to anybody interested that this isn't the miazaki show anymore, and we're moving past that era.   to me it's like a blessing in disguise.  to be blunt, miazaki webbed together a story of lies to lure in investors like you and me into the ideas of grandeur.  on one side, those ideas were not necessarily true on his side (due to the mass selling), but on the other side those ideas become reality for all the rest of us as investors.  so he really did, intentionally or not, build an amazing community that surpassed the need for him at the helm.    i equate this to like a NG+ mode.  we are kind of starting this game over but we have all of the tools and skills that we've acquired over the past year at our disposal.  this is incredibly bullish and i feel a lot better about the direction of the project now, than i have for a few months.",2,1737420931.0,2025-01-21 00:55:31
