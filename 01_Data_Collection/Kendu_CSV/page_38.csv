1i5dgcg,Consistent_Risk_6052,"Like many, I was initially drawn to Kendu by its promising roadmap, enthusiastic community, and the potential for significant returns. The project's buzz was undeniable, and the developer (Dev) was portrayed as a visionary who could deliver on Kendu‚Äôs ambitious goals.  For a time, the optimism felt justified. The community thrived, and the project appeared to be progressing. I invested in Kendu, believing in its promise and in the individuals spearheading the project. However, as time went on, cracks began to form beneath the surface.     Everything changed when the Kendu developer was doxxed. Suddenly, the illusion shattered, and I saw the person behind the project for who they truly were. To put it plainly, I didn‚Äôt like what I saw. Their actions, behavior, and decisions were not aligned with the integrity I had hoped for in a project leader.  I voiced my concerns publicly. I felt a responsibility to call out what I perceived as red flags, even though I knew it might be unpopular. What followed was a swift and severe backlash.  Instead of engaging in constructive dialogue, my concerns were dismissed outright. I was mocked and ridiculed for my views, booted from most Kendu-related social channels, and alienated from a community I once believed in. The rejection was painful, but I stood by my convictions. I had a clear sense of where Kendu was heading, and I knew I couldn‚Äôt stay silent.  Months passed, and one by one, the warnings I had issued manifested into reality. The very issues I had raised‚Äîleadership failures, project mismanagement, and unmet promises‚Äîbecame undeniable. While I took no pleasure in being proven right, it was validating to see my instincts confirmed.",4,1737368418.0,2025-01-20 10:20:18

As for the 1st option as i said its feasible but it would require a lot work especially filtering the bad actors out (most of the addresses are anonymous) so it would be a pain to verify which is which, not impossible though and would remove a good chunk of those that are working against kendu.

We have 17000 holders and I would guess we have some streamers in that pack, so put a Kendu logo on the stream, united internet socials, buy small badges and pins etc to apply to clothes, bags, laptops etc. Just getting people to see the logo and ask ""why"" is something we can all do passively and an opportunity we are missing.",8,1737273781.0,2025-01-19 08:03:01
