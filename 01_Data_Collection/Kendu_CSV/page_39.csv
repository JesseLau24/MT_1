1i4hhvg,PrestigiousAd9825,"I agree with that - I just also have this nagging feeling that with all of the recent tangents and sidebars that it may be tough to tell what's genuinely a perspective on an ethos level and what just may be a loyalist trying to stay whatever course we were on before Miazaki's departure. Even if he's planning on doing all of this anyway, it just feels like something that's worth formally putting into writing as a reference, you know?",9,1737235380.0,2025-01-18 21:23:00
1i4hhvg,RegardedQt314,"good points, i've been honest about my feelings towards how miazkai has run the project lately and i have not been the biggest fan.    however, i still think the underlying message that miazaki set should still be the way forward imo.  the whole ""we don't gamble, we work"" should still be the mindset when it comes to growing Kendu.  what he built can't be denied and he should get his praise for that.    i don't really think anything necessarily changes when it comes to what we have doing with the project, except keeping our words and being as transparent as possible from now on. i do truly think that people have loved this community after joining but the actions from the dev were too much for a lot to stay in the project which i understand.  i think it'll take josh a little bit of time to kind if get things in order and make a proper statement about everything.  but i love that everyone is trying to get on the same page and brainstorm how things will be going forward!",11,1737236880.0,2025-01-18 21:48:00
1i4hhvg,PrestigiousAd9825,"Yeah I agree with this too - we've had to fight enough accusations of ""Friendship ended with X thing, Y thing is now my friend"" energy, and outright bashing Miazaki for taking a step back doesn't feel like a productive or flattering way to position whatever we do next.  If we spread a more ""it's time for the community to get back to doing what we do best"" message as a single unit with every chad playing a role in developing that system, it'll spin us out of negativity risk and ultimately keep us from ending the core of our original story with this news.",3,1737243112.0,2025-01-18 23:31:52

1i4hhvg,skillmattic,"KENDU SQUADS!!!! We should develop these squads or small groups of KENDU soldiers all over, NO MATTER THE SIZE whether it's 2 or 242069. Within these groups, we get together over coffee, lunch, etc., as often as you like, and discuss ideas and plans to PROMOTE KENDU and then get to work implementing those plans in the streets, on socials, or whatever. To keep track of the groups, share our work, and stay organized, we create a platform or use an existing platform (Instagram, Facebook, or whatever) to post everything we're doing. We can even come up with names for our groups and have friendly competitions (with maybe rewards for the top 5 hardest working groups) to see what group can work the hardest!

1i4hhvg,PrestigiousAd9825,Love the way you’re thinking about this - I have a similar idea in my forthcoming infodump I plan dropping here when I’m done writing it out!,7,1737235646.0,2025-01-18 21:27:26
1i4hhvg,PrestigiousAd9825,"Here's the first list of three for project objectives I've written up:  **OBJECTIVE 1: BE INEVITABLE**  *Strategy 1a: Get space for Kendu IRL*  I know some folks were surprised to see how much presence coins like $HEGE and $POWSCHE were able to get with a smaller MC than ours, and how flash-in-the-pan projects like $CHILLGUY were able to spring up seemingly overnight - but it made complete sense to me considering those were the only projects I've ever seen in local, public spaces (think stickers on stop signs and the like).  We have something even more powerful with Kendu - a large team of creative minds who know how to build branded products and services. With a little investment and some tactical thinking, we could blow the lid wide open in where people can see, find, and ask about us and what we're up to.  Ex. The NFL's NFC Championship Game is happening next Sunday. Let's say Detroit wins this week and gets to host it at home. Why do we not have a group of Detroit-based chads yet who's job it is to hand out Kendu Energy drinks for free at the tailgate? We could develop a community fund to expense sending the drinks there, pay the chads involved a little bonus for their time/shilling work, and use the photos to promote on social media the way Red Bull has.  *Strategy 1b: Find our tribe where others aren't looking*  The most bullish aspect of this cycle for me has been hearing from people who aren't invested in crypto. I've met people who refuse to buy BTC because they think it's ""destroying the environment"" and others who have only even heard of meme coins because of that Hawk Tuah fiasco.  We need to find people who may not be curious themselves about the crypto space yet, but who are still a little curious about why others have gotten into it so much. The kind of people who feel a sense of FOMO because they weren't in on the in-crowd when $GME exploded and feel a sense of injustice around big money calling the shots with their retirement.  Seeing the massive influx of people leaving TikTok for an even more Chinese-based social media app out of spite against the Supreme Court showed me that this rebel streak is alive and well in everyday people - so if we can get a message out that says ""you don't have to bet your life savings to get enough money to pay for your life savings"", it'll build up our holder count, talent base, and general awareness/hype.  Ex. We should start posting memes in places that naturally attract people who would want to root for Kendu - think forums about getting off the grid, cybersecurity-related SM groups, and anywhere else people are worried they won't be able to pull their money out of their bank someday.  *Strategy 1c: A job for every Chad*  If there's a mistake I think this project has made so far, it's been pausing the development of groups/teams for specialized projects that play to their skillsets. We have artists, creatives, marketers, computer programmers, finance nerds, and PR specialists in this group that would be springing headfirst into the action if they didn't worry they'd be looked at as a control freak or rogue by suggesting anything new. This has to change if we want to take full advantage of the opportunity we have.  We should sit down and define our need state for this type of talent - thinking out any scenario we could need someone from the group to flex their skills on our behalf. Maybe there's a TG chat specifically for legal experts or people connected to them that can help us navigate the regulatory process. Maybe we have another just for writers/press specialists who focus on how we position the project in interviews and media quotes. Another for designers and graphic artists to create specific brand guidelines for how the Kendu brand looks in print and on your computer screen.  It shouldn't just be ""let's get to work"" - every chad should either have a space to collaborate with people of a similar professional background/interest, or at the very least, the freedom to eventually be trusted to build that out with leadership once the skill becomes needed and pressing.",3,1737238527.0,2025-01-18 22:15:27
1i4hhvg,PrestigiousAd9825,"**OBJECTIVE 2: NEVER LAND ON OUR BACK HEEL**  *Strategy 2a: Reinforce our floor*  Before we hit ATH, there were several instances where a whale would sell and it would cause a sharp drop in less than an hour (kind of like last night). What would normally be seen as a time to placate holders and stop the bleeding instead became a challenge to get people to double down on their investment - and within hours we would eat the dip so violently it created a butterfly effect where other chads who didn't initially buy in the trough would send more money in to keep the momentum moving and push the price up as quickly as possible. I'd like to recreate that by strategizing how we talk about buying Kendu. The massive benefit we have this time around is exchange access - even if we're still fighting to play with the big boys. If I were to see a chad worrying in the chat about whether it was ""too late"" to profit from a price recovery, I'd give them my honest advice - which is that it doesn't have to be.  Coins that can jump 40%+ in a day look attractive to jeets and uncommitted buyers, but if we start recommending during rallies for people to set aside what they would have thrown into the project and save it for a rainy day by leveraging limit trading, we can recreate this even more efficiently than we have in the past. Prices are cyclical in crypto - burnout from buying high and having to sell low isn't. I legit think we should start directing people who haven't done so already to get onto the exchanges and sink their cash into a grid of buys that makes it harder for those drops to get worse. Even if a whale comes back and tries a flash crash to sell all of their position, I can't imagine it'll be a bad thing when half the chat just boosted their position 20% without having to think or worry about the price because it's already recovered from that low.  This strat also gives us more bandwidth to regulate our growth - people who'd be tempted or may feel guilty taking profit on a 20-40% rally may feel better about doing so if they're not worried it'll be our last green candle. I bet a bunch of them would even do so only to recover a larger position - but they only will if they think Kendu is trending UP. This is critical if we want larger community participation while the new system of leadership takes shape.  *Strategy 2b: Create a plan around our ethos*  A huge part of the community spirit that has dwindled over the last few months is the enthusiasm around the main idea of the project - taking control of your future in crypto by creating a project that is designed to succeed because it's not designed to do anything else. This idea of not hiding behind ""use cases"" like Kendu Chads ""revolutionizing the NFT market"" and making the process of understanding how this project will earn money easy to learn is going to be massive to scale this thing up further.  That's no shade to Chads either - I own three of them myself. I just happen to think they look a lot more valuable to people who see them as a way to ladder up future profit instead of as the sole catalyst that will make us money in the long term. Whether it's Kendu Labs coins, the SOL projects, or anything touching NFTs, it makes our core offering a much tougher sell to new members and will not give people disaffected by crypto a reason to care about the narrative. Does it have to take a back seat? No. But it should at the very least be riding shotgun when we're making a first impression with skeptics and newcomers.  Also - this might be petty, but I'd love to start keeping receipts on negative CoinGecko and CMC comments. Imagine if you were just learning about Kendu and peeped the chart, only to see a comment calling the project ""dead"" followed by a response days later showing a full recovery + some growth with triple the likes on it. Feels like a missed opportunity to organize keeping this negativity in check.  *Strategy 2c: Use transparency to drive focus*  Speaking of which, the haters of this project have also picked up on the lack of transparency we currently have and are trying to beat us over the head with it. It's taken all of our latest accomplishments, like being the first project in the history of the blockchain to vote their way to a free Certik audit, and drowned them out in the noise of skepticism and FUD from complete strangers. We cannot arm these people with the tools to own our public spaces online.  Voting for 5-star ratings on CMC and Lewk is a great start, but there's nothing more valuable to our long-term optics than being able to sit in our truth and own that we truly are what we stand for. I think this means re-committing to the idea of being positive and aspirational - to get even people who think we're all crazy to start rooting for us because they see we're trying to do something, and aren't just playing an elaborate game of follow-the-leader with someone who hasn't delivered on the shots they've called.  People shouldn't care about us because they think they might be able to watch someone staple a sheet of paper to their forehead - they should care because they can understand what we're trying to do and see how collaborative the process of making something great can be. That's what wins us holder count, investment, and a fighting shot at these elusive T1 exchanges.",3,1737240830.0,2025-01-18 22:53:50
1i4hhvg,PrestigiousAd9825,"**OBJECTIVE 3: MAKE FOMO OUR FUEL**  *Strategy 3a: Commit to mass appeal/adoption*  We used to be SO, SO good about creating an environment that could appeal to anybody who got involved. I know several people personally who I was soft-launching Kendu to when we were near ATH who wouldn't touch Kendu with a 20-foot pole today: not because of the price or the leadership struggles, but because they'd dip out the second they saw a meme that got too political or unfocused to make us look serious and not like some niche bro-coin that could be rugged at any moment. We've GOT to get back there to ignite the rocket.  As we redevelop a community ethos and think of ways to make Kendu look appealing to the next generation of chads who will help us grow further, we have to reinforce the idea that the group will inevitably take the shape of what we make it to be. If there's any kind of content, political or otherwise, that alienates people into thinking they won't get a piece of the pie or credit for what they contribute, that kind of unwelcoming energy creates a poison that artificially limits our potential and exposes us to an unfathomable opportunity cost. A proper set of communication guidelines or even just a team that can regularly go outside and control the narrative of what we stand for and what we want to do feels like an easy way to insulate ourselves from this cost.  *Strategy 3b: Use our stats to tell a story*  Right now, we have over 16,000 holders who have each bought into what we're doing. We pumped up the price 10x higher than this with fewer than half that holder count just half a year ago. The potential of what's possible with our philosophy is the best tool in our arsenal to succeed - and if we organize building a formal narrative and series of talking points to explain in plain, simple terms why this potential exists, we have the chance to get that price ratio back.  I don't think there's any harm in speculating about what Kendu could be worth someday, or even what it should be worth if we do everything right from this point forward - but if we can visualize what we've been able to accomplish already using our past as the proof, it opens the right kind of doors to get people to genuinely buy in. No more of this ""trying to get the attention of then beefing with whatever crypto influencer is fading us"" shit - what we're doing should make sense to a new buyer without a third-party opinion from any ""expert"" validating what we're saying. Positive attention is great and negative attention is news, but if the narrative is a return to community control, we have to be able to prove it without having to be at the mercy of external influence to permit our success. ""Attract, don't chase"" and all that jazz.  *Strategy 3c: Get back into the conversation*  Memecoin development isn't a game of speed - it's a game of acceleration. If we build tactics around organizing the community to invest at pre-determined periods of time, we could re-enter the top trending charts on all of those platforms we used to take for granted. Maybe we just have a day where we boost the trade volume like crazy by telling everyone to trade on a few key focus exchanges. Maybe we have a day where everyone buys $5 worth of Kendu at a pre-determined time regardless of what the price is to throw a match into the metaphorical gas tank.  If we build organization and infrastructure that allows us to make big waves, and follow that up with a dedicated team of informed leadership that can make a great impression when we're asked about those waves, it would put us in league with what every billion dollar project has had to have by necessity.  We can believe in 10x, 50x, 100x+ growth all we want... but the people who will inevitably be responsible for finding the chads who will finance that are going to need a good reason why. We cannot afford to put the cart before the horse on this and prioritizing our public relations/optics beyond a comment section raid or like spamming exercise will prove critical to do that.",3,1737242707.0,2025-01-18 23:25:07

In hindsight, I should have been more cautious and scrutinized the project and its leadership more thoroughly.  What adds to the shame is knowing that my family trusted me. They believed in my judgment and acted on my recommendation, only for the investment to falter due to issues I couldn’t foresee at the time.
