1jxirbw,Electronic_Crew_3708,Yes I think it will outperform it 1million%  Look at shiba inu after it hits his ATH and now Pepe and there is much more shiba and Pepe coins than kendu inu also kendu does have a great Community with beasts who are working on Merch and even a video game  😌,32,1744469114.0,2025-04-12 14:45:14
1jxirbw,RegardedQt314,"you'll probably get some bias answers asking a question like that here :p but imo Kendu has more room for growth.  Pepe will probably do good but you probably won't see as much growth in terms of percentage increase.    but im also always wary of the ""trying to recoup your loses by selling at lows game"", because i used to always fail at it 😆.  if you're down 50% already on pepe, it might not be the worst to try and at least wait till it gets back to your original investment before you take it out.    i would say it's up to you ultimately but if you know Kendu then you know the potential.  good luck on your decision 🫵🦊",25,1744470053.0,2025-04-12 15:00:53

At Kendu, the motto is ""We don't gamble, We work,"" a sharp contrast to the prevailing culture in much of DeFi.

KENDU AUDIT:  Kendu is the second memecoin in history after Pepe to organically reach the 50,000 votes needed for a free CertiK audit.

1jwxdp9,phi_curious,"Hi L3nni8, thanks for the proactive post. I like that you open the conversation.   Also wanna give a shout out to u/CoopVelociraptor who brought this up in the TG and who will have good input.  Sorry for the unstructured post. These are just my random thoughts:  From my point of view we need to add more content that is not just a random ""smash this"" or ""smash that"", we need content that is funny, that opens a conversation, content that is different and thoughtful.  If we make content that is fun and engaging people naturally come back, because they want to hang out here, and that will also increase our ""smash"" effort.   I have been thinking on how I can contribute, maybe people can give some input on these:  1. post more memes [https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu\_Ecosystem/comments/1jw2rp7/happy\_thursday\_chads\_chadettes](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/comments/1jw2rp7/happy_thursday_chads_chadettes)  2. write articles that are thought provoking [https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu\_Ecosystem/comments/1jvy5zk/did\_you\_read\_the\_snack\_machine\_post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/comments/1jvy5zk/did_you_read_the_snack_machine_post)  3. make a GM post that sets the mood for the day, e.g. a fortune cookie wisdom of the day, or a window of the day. I like the 24h recaps because they are important to create a tight bond between community members, and I think that a similar format that is focused on how to move forward could be interesting. I am not sure yet though what that would exactly be.  In the end though, whatever kind of content each individual creates, it has to be fun to the creator. It should never feel like a task that you have to do, but rather something that you enjoy.",15,1744398399.0,2025-04-11 19:06:39
1jwxdp9,CoopVelociraptor,"Agreed! More actual content, and it’s cool that we’re thinking about it but tbh we could ez start with what we already blast on X.  Maybe just to tidy things up we could pin a “Daily Raid Post” where everyone throws that stuff in there.

That is a good idea, I guess we could make a pinned post where we post the raid targets, just need to be smart about how we do it otherwise old threads are getting raided lol  As for X content, can you elaborate more? I agree that some of our content on X suits well on here, eg the kojak articles, you video game teasers…what else though?

I see the same one token recently posting everywhere nonstop the same recycled content.   I don't know because I have rose colored glasses on and I just love Kendu but I wonder if people view us in the same way as I view that coin.

We are stuck again in a range of holder up and down up and down (market PR baby the real challenge and we just need to keep going) I guess I think more purposeful to invite people in is my addition to this convo (yes very late I know, but here I am doing what I can when I can).

I kept seeing post after post and saw the passion in them. Saw the positive comments and just overall genuine belief in people that this was truly a unique project.  Then, one day, scrolling through posts I felt that belief too. It truly is a unique feeling. And I know even those that have sold and moved on to buying into other project are keeping their eyes on KENDU.
