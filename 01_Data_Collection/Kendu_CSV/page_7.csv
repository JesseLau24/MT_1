1juiy0i,Potlimitcrypto,Glad you could get in! If you need any help he sure to stick to public forums. Ignore all dms because scammers prey on messages like this.  Look forward to seeing you around more! Be sure to join the Telegram and hang out. 🙂,8,1744143417.0,2025-04-08 20:16:57
1juiy0i,NoTalonNoParty,"Ha, thanks for the warning, I even got a dm that seems sketchy. I will definitely check out the telegram. Could you explain me like I’m ( what Kendu is exactly. To me it seems like a brand more than a coin, with a lot of people working to make the brand grow",8,1744143677.0,2025-04-08 20:21:17
1juiy0i,Potlimitcrypto,"Well, to everyone it's something different but to me is a giant permissionless brand umbrella that extends from onchain into real world businesses and products. There is nothing that can't be built with Kendu. There is no avenue that can't be explored under the Kendu umbrella. The goal is to be everywhere all the time and culturally endlessly support the project's growth via voluntary donations/kickbacks from the businesses launching under the umbrella in various ways.   The new website goes into it in a bit more detail, Kendu.io.  Join the Telegram and scope it out for a while. 🙂",9,1744144001.0,2025-04-08 20:26:41
1juiy0i,phi_curious,"It sounds like your ETH is on base, correct? If yes you need to select the base CA for Kendu  and make sure to swap your ETH on base. Be careful to use the correct CA, do not search by name.  The CA for Kendu you can either find on the kenduinu X profile in the linked kendu carrd. Or in the TG. Or on CMC under contracts at the bottom of the page (if on phone).  https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu   Does this help? If not let me know.",7,1744132937.0,2025-04-08 17:22:17
1juiy0i,NoTalonNoParty,"Thanks for the reply! Yeah, my ETH is on base. WHat do you mean by CA? I used this ""adress"" (I know not the right term): 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18  that a Mod posted in a replay two days ago.  Edit: Just saw that this: 0xef73611F98DA6E57e0776317957af61B59E09Ed7 is for BASE, thought it might work, but now it says ""no routes available""",8,1744133150.0,2025-04-08 17:25:50

1juiy0i,phi_curious,"Just saw the edit, you say you try to swap on uniswap? I think this is the issue.  The liquidity pool on base is on aerodrome finance   Try to swap there.  See under markets on CMC: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu",7,1744133851.0,2025-04-08 17:37:31
1juiy0i,NoTalonNoParty,"Thanks a lot, the new CA and trying aerodrome seem to work (still swaps and takes kinda long) but it is swapping! Thanks! I hope it will work, swapping for a few minutes now. If it doesnt, I'll coem back to you :)",10,1744134290.0,2025-04-08 17:44:50

1juiy0i,phi_curious,"Edit: check my other comment.  The CA is the contract address, so you got the term correct :)  However the address you are using is when you want to swap Kendu on the Ethereum chain, not on base.  This is the CA for Kendu on base: 0xef73611f98da6e57e0776317957af61b59e09ed7  You should verify this through one of the platforms I have stated above. Always verify and double check, do not trust information given by others blindly.  Then check if the swap works. If not I can help again, I haven’t swapped on base in a while and usually have done it directly in phantom wallet. So need to think lol",4,1744133731.0,2025-04-08 17:35:31

1juc5up,RegardedQt314,"i've been muted by telegram so i didn't get a chance to ask more about this, but how are you guys deciding what is worthy of posting in this new channel? is there going to be a lot of overlap of posts that need to be smashed between channels?   i like the idea, just curious to hear what your vision is for this idea and why it's worth joining as opposed to just checking the pinned messages in the main channel. sorry if my tone comes off as like dismissive, i am genuinely interested.",4,1744144358.0,2025-04-08 20:32:38
1juc5up,SpeakerClassic4418,"The main TG is the TG.  It's for all purposes and having fun.  With its fast paced nature it's great for raiding on X when time is of the essence.    Kendu army barracks has no talking, it's more of a simple pinned format of major reddit posts, polls we want to win and any big news, stayseaarts newest, upcoming festival is a great current example.    It is not meant to be used instead of the Main TG, but to compliment it.  You can log into kendu army barracks 1-2 times a day, like the posts and comments to it, and comment yourself.  Vote in a poll, etc.  Most days will only have 2-4 actual actions to take.  Another example I want to get in there is the stocktwits initiative.    Join up and check it out.  If you hold kendu, remember, you're working for your own bag and I just want to make it a little easier to get more done for more of us!  Thanks for the great question!",4,1744153156.0,2025-04-08 22:59:16
1juc5up,RegardedQt314,"thanks for the reply, sounds like it should act as a quick daily pit stop so see what major posts need attention.    this idea sort of reminds me of the days when we had a seperate telegram channel for the reddit crowd. not exactly the same but i liked having a less crowded avenue to focus in a specific aspect of Kendu.    hopefully your idea works out and people utilize it to some extent.  i can always appreciate trying new things!",3,1744155417.0,2025-04-08 23:36:57
