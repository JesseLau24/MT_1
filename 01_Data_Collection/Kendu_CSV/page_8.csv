1jt7c04,RegardedQt314,it is a good idea to always search tokens using contract addresses as opposed to just the name because of the risk of copycat tokens.   Kendu's native token is built on Ethereum but we are wormholed to Solana and Base too so we have 3 different contract addresses and you'll just need to keep that in mind when purchasing depending on what chain you want to use.   here are the contract addresses for each chain:   ETH: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18  SOL: 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45  BASE: 0xef73611F98DA6E57e0776317957af61B59E09Ed7  it is also recommended to verify contract addresses through official channels like our telegram or verified X account.  edit: also do not reply to dms about this post because 99.9% of the time it is someone trying to scam you.,1,1743981883.0,2025-04-06 23:24:43

1jrlz0k,TheGDC33,Yo this recap is something I am finally learning how best to utilize. For example that Lewk debate summary is something on my mind for sometime.

1jrjj94,phi_curious,"Imho speaking on spaces is one of the best ways to make meaningful connections on X and to promote Kendu. It also puts you in a different mindset because you have to be more clear with your thoughts: what is kendu? What makes it so special? Why should you join the community?  Naturally not everybody feels comfortable with speaking publicly. But this is something everybody can learn and get comfortable with. Take it step by step. Talk in a VC in the TG or one of our unrecorded spaces. Next start in one of our recorded spaces, or the Kendu community space. Then branch out to some of the more relaxed and smaller spaces on X that are not Kendu related, e.g. Troll King Kendu (a proper Kendu chad) hosts regular spaces where you can talk about anything.   Right now is a perfect time to get started with this. The market has slowed down, spaces are less packed and busy. So this is perfect to learn before the craziness of the storm and to make lasting connections. And beyond helping Kendu, it also will help you as a person.  Maybe we can organize a space where we just talk about that. How to speak on spaces?",13,1743793184.0,2025-04-04 18:59:44

It's helpful and encouraging to see how the community steps up with their own unique skillsets to build kendu into a multifaceted platform. Imagine if kendu would have launched to -10b a year ago. It would just be like another memecoin with no real community support to propel it further. The community is actively preparing the framework for not just another coin. It's THE COIN. We are building the next generation of crypto community platforms. We are integrating crypto into all faucets of life. Would our determination and drive be at the level it is now if we had just been given listing's from top exchanges? I'm not sure. It's because we got to work for kendu as a community, thats the reason we will propel into the billions and beyond.
