1jncs4i,_brap_,"With any size bag you’ll have to ask yourself: what mcap would it need to go to for me to be satisfied with my gains.   Be realistic with yourself and adjust your bag accordingly.  While 30m might nog make you financially free, it will sure as heck give you that boost in life to potentially make the first step to becoming really wealthy.",19,1743347168.0,2025-03-30 15:06:08

1jncs4i,Honos11,Any bag is decent.  Just always put in what your able to sit on.  If your going to need to pull this money out in a week then your bag is to big.  But look at it this way.  If we make it to the goal of 100 billion market cap that bag would be worth 3 million US and if we make it to Shiba Inus max market cap that's 1.2 million US.,22,1743342997.0,2025-03-30 13:56:37
1jncs4i,_brap_,"Idk about 100b, even though it’s a great goal to strive for. 1-10b seems possible imo, which would give him 30-300k. This can still be life changing depending on where he’s from",14,1743347270.0,2025-03-30 15:07:50
