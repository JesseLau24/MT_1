Also a huge shout out to [LadyTraderRA ](https://x.com/LadyTraderRa)for hosting this awesome X Space! I took his bullet-points and made it into this summary. It's a must listen, and after the latest updates from the April 21st community call, it’s honestly wild how far Kendu has come. If you're expecting another pump-and-dump meme token, you're not paying attention. Kendu is no longer a gamble. It’s a movement.\n\n**From Dev Rug to Community Resurrection**\n\nLet’s rewind for a second. Kendu should have been dead months ago. The original developer rugged 5% of the supply and bailed, right as the market was crashing and liquidity was being sucked into Trump-themed meme coins. That would have been the end for most projects. But not here. The community rallied, kicked the bad actor out, and kept building. Not only did Kendu survive, it started thriving.\n\n**Kendu Games: AAA Dev Comes Out of Retirement**\n\nThis is the biggest news. [Coop](https://x.com/WhatDidCoopSay), a community member, is now launching a legitimate game studio under the $KENDU umbrella, named; Kendu Games. Not a half-baked crypto game or a easy cash-grab. A full-scale traditional RPG, with serious developers. The lead dev? A former triple AAA game developer and BioWare veteran who worked on Dragon Age, Mass Effect, and Baldur’s Gate. He literally came out of retirement for this, purely because he believes in what Kendu is doing. The plan is to create a Skyrim-style RPG, followed by a roguelite later. No crypto gimmicks in the gameplay. But the kicker is that game profits will be used to buy Kendu tokens and fund the community. Here's a small breakdown, from all the profits 10% will go into a Kendu Games Business treasury and 5% will be donated to the Kendu Community wallet. let's say they hit one million copies sold, which is likely to happen, that’s an estimated $1.6 million in buy pressure for Kendu. That’s just from one game.\n\n[Kendu Games Teaser](https://reddit.com/link/1k5v8uz/video/21hs1llz3kwe1/player)\n\n[Kendu Games X Profile](https://x.com/KenduGames)\n\n**Decentralized Brand, Real-World Impact**\n\nKendu isn’t just building in digital spaces. The brand is exploding in the real world too. Members of the community have launched Kendu Coffee, Kendu Energy Drinks, Kendu Vodka, Kendu Nights (club promotions), and even Kendu Esports, a League of Legends team. What makes this different from every other project? It’s all permissionless. Anyone can build under the Kendu brand without needing to ask for approval. There is no centralized entity handing out licenses. This is decentralized brand ownership in action.\n\n[Kendu Energy Promo Video](https://reddit.com/link/1k5v8uz/video/glalrqaf0kwe1/player)\n\n**\"We Don’t Gamble, We Work\"**\n\nThis has become the core philosophy of Kendu. The project isn’t about flipping tokens or hoping for pumps. It’s about showing up and putting in the work. Token holders treat Kendu like a startup. There are daily goals, power hours, and people grinding social content and launching real-life products. The Kendu community is working, not speculating.\n\n**No Paid Hype, No Insiders**\n\nOne of the most refreshing parts of Kendu is how it’s grown. There are no paid influencers, no whales with insider allocations, and no VC dumping risk. Everyone buys with their own money. Everyone contributes with their own effort. It’s raw, organic, and surprisingly effective. The project has reached over 18,000 holders this way. Not through hype, but through work.\n\n**Wormhole Bridge: Building for the Long Game**\n\nKendu has also quietly launched bridges to the Solana and Base chains. This wasn’t a PR stunt or hype strategy. It was a tactical move, preparing for the moment when momentum returns. The goal is simple: dominate the top gainers list across multiple chains in the long term. This kind of forward-thinking infrastructure sets Kendu apart from typical meme coins. And the cool addition to this; let's say Solana moves up in price? This will automatically drive the price of $KENDU without any added buy pressure.\n\n[$KENDU Available on 3 Chains](https://preview.redd.it/xsfz0acl0kwe1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b5d217c5cbde150aca3baaee6f54ef8e8d014b6)\n\n**No Roadmap, Just Vision**\n\nKendu isn’t promising the moon on a whiteboard full of deadlines. There’s no traditional roadmap. Instead, the focus is on empowering the community to launch initiatives organically. A white paper is currently being written, but it’s meant to lay out a vision, not a list of promises. A grants program is also planned for the future, once the project hits a market cap between $50 million and $100 million. That funding will help support community-led ventures like festivals, shops, or new product lines.\n\n**Different From Other Meme Coins**\n\nKendu isn’t trying to be the next dog-themed token or celebrity-endorsed project. It’s more serious than the average meme coin, more decentralized than celebrity tokens like TrumpCoin, and not botted, but entirely organically build, by REAL human beings. Kendu is trying to build something new, a culture-powered brand that can live in both crypto and the real world.\n\n**The Builders Speak**\n\nThe people behind Kendu aren’t shy about what they’re building. Josh, one of the core community leads, says he’s never seen a project with this much promise. He points out that Kendu has matched the social output of projects 20 times its size. Kevin, another day-one supporter, compares the project’s vibe to Silicon Valley in the 80s, MTV culture in the 90s, and the early internet boom. It’s culture, investing, and creativity all rolled into one.\n\n[Josh](https://x.com/JoshKendu): ''*I've never seen a project with so much promise before. Kendu should really be dead right now – but the community has kept it alive and actually growing. We frequently match the social output of projects 20x our size like MOG, PEPE, and SHIB. Kendu is insanely undervalued considering our output right now – and the morewe grow, the faster that output will scale.*''\n\n[Kevin](https://x.com/_KEVINFINNERTY): ''*The stickiness of the community is what made my eyebrows raise from the start. You can't build to 18,000 holders from hype alone – it’s people working 24/7. In crypto, you can join a 'company' like Kendu and actually contribute to it, build with it, and own part of it. That’s never existed before. We are severely undervalued at $10m. We’re going to billions.*''\n\n[Jeff ](https://x.com/LowQ_eth)(Co-Host): ''*KENDU is legit looking like the early days of SHIB but without the dev drama risk now. It’s more of a decentralised brand incubator than a meme coin at this point. If KENDU Games delivers even medium success, it could be absolutely massive for the tokenomics. Right now it's sitting at a tiny $10m market cap, massively undervalued compared to the ecosystem we’re building.*''\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nKendu should’ve died after bad choices by the developer and a market crash. Instead, the community kicked into overdrive, launching real-world products, bridging to new chains, and now even building a AAA-style RPG with a retired BioWare dev. It’s not a meme coin anymore — it’s a decentralized brand, built by people who work, not gamble. And at just $10 million market cap, the whole thing still feels massively undervalued.\n\n[\\/KENDU\\_IS\\_COMMUNITY](https://reddit.com/link/1k5v8uz/video/cpkm2b7n2kwe1/player)\n\n🦊 **Official $KENDU Telegram Group**: [https://t.me/KenduInu](https://t.me/KenduInu) \n\n🦊 **Official $KENDU Website**: [https://www.kendu.io](https://www.kendu.io) \n\n🦊 **Official $KENDU Twitter: Twitter**: [https://x.com/KenduInu](https://x.com/KenduInu)\n\n💲**KENDU CA:**\n\n🔗 **ETH** \\- 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18\n\n🔗 **SOL** \\- 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45\n\n🔗 **BASE** \\- 0xef73611F98DA6E57e0776317957af61B59E09Ed7\n\n\nAnd with that being said; **/KENDU\\_IS\\_COMMUNITY** 🦊**🪖**",

Also a huge shout out to &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/LadyTraderRa\"&gt;LadyTraderRA &lt;/a&gt;for hosting this awesome X Space! I took his bullet-points and made it into this summary. It&amp;#39;s a must listen, and after the latest updates from the April 21st community call, it’s honestly wild how far Kendu has come. If you&amp;#39;re expecting another pump-and-dump meme token, you&amp;#39;re not paying attention. Kendu is no longer a gamble. It’s a movement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Dev Rug to Community Resurrection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let’s rewind for a second. Kendu should have been dead months ago. The original developer rugged 5% of the supply and bailed, right as the market was crashing and liquidity was being sucked into Trump-themed meme coins. That would have been the end for most projects. But not here. The community rallied, kicked the bad actor out, and kept building. Not only did Kendu survive, it started thriving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kendu Games: AAA Dev Comes Out of Retirement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the biggest news. &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/WhatDidCoopSay\"&gt;Coop&lt;/a&gt;, a community member, is now launching a legitimate game studio under the $KENDU umbrella, named; Kendu Games. Not a half-baked crypto game or a easy cash-grab. A full-scale traditional RPG, with serious developers. The lead dev? A former triple AAA game developer and BioWare veteran who worked on Dragon Age, Mass Effect, and Baldur’s Gate. He literally came out of retirement for this, purely because he believes in what Kendu is doing. The plan is to create a Skyrim-style RPG, followed by a roguelite later. No crypto gimmicks in the gameplay. But the kicker is that game profits will be used to buy Kendu tokens and fund the community. Here&amp;#39;s a small breakdown, from all the profits 10% will go into a Kendu Games Business treasury and 5% will be donated to the Kendu Community wallet. let&amp;#39;s say they hit one million copies sold, which is likely to happen, that’s an estimated $1.6 million in buy pressure for Kendu. That’s just from one game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/1k5v8uz/video/21hs1llz3kwe1/player\"&gt;Kendu Games Teaser&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://x.com/KenduGames\"&gt;Kendu Games X Profile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decentralized Brand, Real-World Impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kendu isn’t just building in digital spaces. The brand is exploding in the real world too. Members of the community have launched Kendu Coffee, Kendu Energy Drinks, Kendu Vodka, Kendu Nights (club promotions), and even Kendu Esports, a League of Legends team. What makes this different from every other project? It’s all permissionless. Anyone can build under the Kendu brand without needing to ask for approval. There is no centralized entity handing out licenses. This is decentralized brand ownership in action.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/1k5v8uz/video/glalrqaf0kwe1/player\"&gt;Kendu Energy Promo Video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;We Don’t Gamble, We Work&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This has become the core philosophy of Kendu. The project isn’t about flipping tokens or hoping for pumps. It’s about showing up and putting in the work. Token holders treat Kendu like a startup. There are daily goals, power hours, and people grinding social content and launching real-life products. The Kendu community is working, not speculating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Paid Hype, No Insiders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the most refreshing parts of Kendu is how it’s grown. There are no paid influencers, no whales with insider allocations, and no VC dumping risk. Everyone buys with their own money. Everyone contributes with their own effort. It’s raw, organic, and surprisingly effective. The project has reached over 18,000 holders this way. Not through hype, but through work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wormhole Bridge: Building for the Long Game&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kendu has also quietly launched bridges to the Solana and Base chains. This wasn’t a PR stunt or hype strategy. It was a tactical move, preparing for the moment when momentum returns. The goal is simple: dominate the top gainers list across multiple chains in the long term. This kind of forward-thinking infrastructure sets Kendu apart from typical meme coins. And the cool addition to this; let&amp;#39;s say Solana moves up in price? This will automatically drive the price of $KENDU without any added buy pressure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xsfz0acl0kwe1.jpg?width=1280&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9b5d217c5cbde150aca3baaee6f54ef8e8d014b6\"&gt;$KENDU Available on 3 Chains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Roadmap, Just Vision&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kendu isn’t promising the moon on a whiteboard full of deadlines. There’s no traditional roadmap. Instead, the focus is on empowering the community to launch initiatives organically. A white paper is currently being written, but it’s meant to lay out a vision, not a list of promises. A grants program is also planned for the future, once the project hits a market cap between $50 million and $100 million. That funding will help support community-led ventures like festivals, shops, or new product lines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Different From Other Meme Coins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kendu isn’t trying to be the next dog-themed token or celebrity-endorsed project. It’s more serious than the average meme coin, more decentralized than celebrity tokens like TrumpCoin, and not botted, but entirely organically build, by REAL human beings. Kendu is trying to build something new, a culture-powered brand that can live in both crypto and the real world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Builders Speak&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The people behind Kendu aren’t shy about what they’re building. Josh, one of the core community leads, says he’s never seen a project with this much promise. He points out that Kendu has matched the social output of projects 20 times its size. Kevin, another day-one supporter, compares the project’s vibe to Silicon Valley in the 80s, MTV culture in the 90s, and the early internet boom. It’s culture, investing, and creativity all rolled into one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://x.com/JoshKendu\"&gt;Josh&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never seen a project with so much promise before. Kendu should really be dead right now – but the community has kept it alive and actually growing. We frequently match the social output of projects 20x our size like MOG, PEPE, and SHIB. Kendu is insanely undervalued considering our output right now – and the morewe grow, the faster that output will scale.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://x.com/_KEVINFINNERTY\"&gt;Kevin&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;em&gt;The stickiness of the community is what made my eyebrows raise from the start. You can&amp;#39;t build to 18,000 holders from hype alone – it’s people working 24/7. In crypto, you can join a &amp;#39;company&amp;#39; like Kendu and actually contribute to it, build with it, and own part of it. That’s never existed before. We are severely undervalued at $10m. We’re going to billions.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://x.com/LowQ_eth\"&gt;Jeff &lt;/a&gt;(Co-Host): &amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;em&gt;KENDU is legit looking like the early days of SHIB but without the dev drama risk now. It’s more of a decentralised brand incubator than a meme coin at this point. If KENDU Games delivers even medium success, it could be absolutely massive for the tokenomics. Right now it&amp;#39;s sitting at a tiny $10m market cap, massively undervalued compared to the ecosystem we’re building.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kendu should’ve died after bad choices by the developer and a market crash. Instead, the community kicked into overdrive, launching real-world products, bridging to new chains, and now even building a AAA-style RPG with a retired BioWare dev. It’s not a meme coin anymore — it’s a decentralized brand, built by people who work, not gamble. And at just $10 million market cap, the whole thing still feels massively undervalued.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/1k5v8uz/video/cpkm2b7n2kwe1/player\"&gt;/KENDU_IS_COMMUNITY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;🦊 &lt;strong&gt;Official $KENDU Telegram Group&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=\"https://t.me/KenduInu\"&gt;https://t.me/KenduInu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;🦊 &lt;strong&gt;Official $KENDU Website&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=\"https://www.kendu.io\"&gt;https://www.kendu.io&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;🦊 &lt;strong&gt;Official $KENDU Twitter: Twitter&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/KenduInu\"&gt;https://x.com/KenduInu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;💲&lt;strong&gt;KENDU CA:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;🔗 &lt;strong&gt;ETH&lt;/strong&gt; - 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;🔗 &lt;strong&gt;SOL&lt;/strong&gt; - 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;🔗 &lt;strong&gt;BASE&lt;/strong&gt; - 0xef73611F98DA6E57e0776317957af61B59E09Ed7&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And with that being said; &lt;strong&gt;/KENDU_IS_COMMUNITY&lt;/strong&gt; 🦊&lt;strong&gt;🪖&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
