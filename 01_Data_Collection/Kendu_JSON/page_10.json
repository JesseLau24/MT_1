              "selftext": "**A Quick Introduction**   \n  \nKendu is a completely organic memecoin that is on Ethereum, Solana and BASE. We are entirely focused on community and have nearly 18k holders. Whilst I am positive you have seen Kendu either on Twitter, Reddit, Stocktwits, Coin Market Cap, Instagram or wherever else, I will still give a quick overview.  \nKendu is over a year old with an ATH of 283 million, Kendu has went through several redistribution periods and at the time of writing has had 7 green days in a row.  \nKendu is following the same path that Pepe, Shib and Doge created back when they ran to the billions. This process typically takes longer than a KOL based memecoin, but it has a much higher potential for returns. Furthermore, this method is tried and tested, all we need to do is push Kendu along that same path.  \nKendu has reached 50k votes to earn a free Certik audit, the only other coin to ever do this was Pepe... I mean that should tell you a lot. Certik is a very reputable, crypto security platform, Kendu got an A rating which is insanely good.  \nKendu has great distribution too, which is getting better all the time, our holders seem to grow daily even in the terrible market.  \nKendu has lots of IRL products which bridge DEFI to the real world, this is very attractive to retail investors, as IRL products show authenticity.  \nKendu is more than a memecoin, we are a BRAND.  \nWhat makes me insanely bullish is the fact that even when many people could have lost a lot of money in the markets downturn, Kendu still pumps out IRL products. Imagine what will happen when Kendu is in the billions :0\n\n  \n**IRL Products and Events**\n\nKendu has many IRL products: Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Merch, Kendu animation, Kendu games, Kendu Gum, Kendu Creator, Kendu pendants, Kendu Beer, Kendu Video Games and Kendu Games.  \nKendu was at Miami Art Basel, NoSleep305 was present and even created a Kendu Mural in a very busy part of Miami  \nKendu Entertainment(ran by Ishan) is hosting Pickleball events in India, which is a very popular sport in India. This is gathering lots of traction in the Pickleball community and has been a great success so far.\n\nFrom India to Miami. Kendu is truly global\n\n**Miami Music Week**\n\nMiami Music Week is kicking off and Kendu is a head sponsor of this. This is absolutely massive as around 165,000 people are expected to go. StaySeaArt, NoSleep305 and Inkstradamus are leading the charge in the Miami heat :)  \nKendu Energy, Kendu Merch and cocktails made from Kendu Energy will be given out to the attendees of this event.   \nNoSleep305 were behind the iconic Kendu Mural in Miami and Inkstradamus are making the Kendu Merch. Whilst StaySeaArt designed the Kendu Cocktail Menu. They will go down in Kendu history.\n\n  \n**Kendu Creator**\n\nKendu Creator is a website created by a chad called Akabe, where you can 3d print a Kendu mask. Whilst wearing this mask, you can play drums(like Akabe), lift weights, dance, sing.... the list goes on. This is a project to get Kendu on all forms and areas of social media, this is gonna be great, soon people will be seeing drums, people singing and running all wearing a Kendu mask. This is truly a revolutionary idea and it could make Kendu viral. We also have the Akabe mask as a filter on TikTok, so you can create a TikTok video without actually printing the mask. This gives access to the Akabe mask to everyone.  \nAkabe has mentioned the discipline that Kendu creator has brought to his life, Kendu creator has gave him a lot of discipline to practice to drums daily to improve the content he can make. Akabe says Kendu creator gives people purpose and it pushes people to become a better version of themselves whilst pushing Kendu to the top. This is wonderful and it shows the Ken-Du mentality.\n\nI cannot stress this enough, this is one of the best ideas that has came out of Kendu so far!!!\n\n**What to look for in a Memecoin and why Kendu has that**\n\nA community is what gives memecoins value and Kendu has arguably the best community in crypto. We are at the base of the biggest AltSeason in Crypto history, we truly have the potential to 1000x and in my opinion we can 3000x. Shib went from 22 million to 22 billion in 36 days(with far less money in the market), so why can't Kendu? It has already been proven that community is all you need, so what are you waiting for?  \nJoin the Telegram and check out the community even if you are not a holder. We would love to have you.  \nSkip the Dominos Cheese Pizza and put the $15 into Kendu, where imo you could make $15000. This is not an opportunity you want to miss.  \nAll the signs were there...\n\nI want to sincerely wish everyone good luck for the bull run, no matter whether you are in Kendu or not :)\n\nAlways remember, to never bet against a community\n\nWe Don't Gamble, We Work\n\n[r/KenduInu\\_Ecosystem](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/)\n\nETH: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18\n\nSOL: 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45\n\nBASE: 0xef73611F98DA6E57e0776317957af61B59E09Ed7\n\nCG: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu)  \nCMC: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)",

              "selftext": "**Kendu Overview**\n\nKendu is a completely organic memecoin that is on Ethereum, Solana and BASE. We are entirely focused on community and have nearly 18k holders. Whilst I am positive you have seen Kendu either on Twitter, Reddit, Stocktwits, Coin Market Cap, Instagram or wherever else, I will still give a quick overview.  \nKendu is over a year old with an ATH of 283 million, Kendu has went through several redistribution periods and at the time of writing has had 7 green days in a row.  \nKendu is following the same path that Pepe, Shib and Doge created back when they ran to the billions. This process typically takes longer than a KOL based memecoin, but it has a much higher potential for returns.  \nKendu has many IRL products and Events and they are very important for a memecoin, as it is very attractive for potential holders. Kendu's IRL output is a testament to its strength, the fact that the community has managed this before Kendu has reached the billions, is nothing short of a miracle.  \nIt is plain to see where Kendu is going, we are destined for the billions.  \nKendu has reached 50k votes to earn a free Certik audit, the only other coin to ever do this was Pepe...  \nThis Certik Audit gave us an A rating, which is very good!!!\n\nKendu has multiple international communities incase English is not your first language:🇮🇳 India,🇪🇸 Spanish,🇦🇪 Arabic, 🇫🇷 French, 🇩🇪 German, 🇵🇹 Portuguese, 🇷🇺 Russian, 🇨🇳 Chinese, 🇯🇵 Japanese, 🇮🇩 Indonesian, 🇰🇷 Korean, 🇹🇭 Thai, 🇹🇷 Turkish, 🇿🇦 Zulu.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/508nl3bwpmre1.png?width=1116&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fba896883d2605a6d1d86229c76033b4ac211c1\n\n**IRL Products and Event**\n\nKendu has many IRL products: Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Merch, Kendu animation, Kendu games, Kendu Gum, Kendu Creator, Kendu pendants, Kendu Beer, Kendu Video Games and Kendu Games.  \nKendu was at Miami Art Basel, NoSleep305 was present and even created a Kendu Mural in a very busy part of Miami  \nKendu Entertainment(ran by Ishan) is hosting Pickleball events in India, which is a very popular sport in India. This is gathering lots of traction in the Pickleball community and has been a great success so far.\n\nFrom India to Miami. Kendu is truly global\n\n**Miami Music Week**\n\nMiami Music Week is kicking off and Kendu is a head sponsor of this. This is absolutely massive as around 165,000 people are expected to go. StaySeaArt, NoSleep305 and Inkstradamus are leading the charge in the Miami heat :)  \nKendu Energy, Kendu Merch and cocktails made from Kendu Energy will be given out to the attendees of this event. This is a great opportunity for Kendu and to go in with a green chart, the sky is the limit!!!  \nNoSleep305 were behind the iconic Kendu Mural in Miami and Inkstradamus are making the Kendu Merch. Whilst StaySeaArt designed the Kendu Cocktail Menu. They will go down in Kendu history.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4p12yrcmpmre1.png?width=1230&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8ec7274bc653b6e41a4e6eacdd1dd6246afcba2\n\n**Kendu Creator**\n\nKendu Creator is a website created by a chad called Akabe, where you can 3d print a Kendu mask. Whilst wearing this mask, you can play drums(like Akabe), lift weights, dance, sing.... the list goes on. This is a project to get Kendu on all forms and areas of social media, this is gonna be great, soon people will be seeing drums, people singing and running all wearing a Kendu mask. This is truly a revolutionary idea and it could make Kendu viral. We also have the Akabe mask as a filter on TikTok, so you can create a TikTok video without actually printing the mask. This gives access to the Akabe mask to everyone.  \nAkabe has mentioned the discipline that Kendu creator has brought to his life, Kendu creator has gave him a lot of discipline to practice to drums daily to improve the content he can make. Akabe says Kendu creator gives people purpose and it pushes people to become a better version of themselves whilst pushing Kendu to the top. This is wonderful and it shows the Ken-Du mentality.\n\nI cannot stress this enough, this is one of the best ideas that has came out of Kendu so far!!!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3cfpy0vhpmre1.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=380ea19bf2079f244d53758f14ffe59d9b6ff076\n\n**What to look for in a Memecoin and why Kendu has that**\n\nA community is what gives memecoins value and Kendu has arguably the best community in crypto, if Shib, Doge and Pepe can accomplish the billions with far less money in the market, why can't Kendu. We are at the base of the biggest AltSeason in Crypto history, we truly have the potential to 1000x and in my opinion we can 3000x. Shib went from 22 million to 22 billion in 36 days, so why can't Kendu? It has already been proven that community is all you need by the 3 coins I have mentioned, so what's stopping Kendu???  \nJoin the Telegram and check out the community even if you are not a holder. We would love to have you.  \nSkip the Frappuccino and put the money into Kendu at the minimum. This is not an opportunity you want to miss.  \nAll the signs were there...\n\nI want to sincerely wish everyone good luck for the bull run, no matter whether you are in Kendu or not :)\n\nWe Don't Gamble, We Work\n\n[r/KenduInu\\_Ecosystem](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/)\n\nETH: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18\n\nSOL: 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45\n\nBASE: 0xef73611F98DA6E57e0776317957af61B59E09Ed7\n\nCG: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu)  \nCMC: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)",

We are entirely focused on community and have nearly 18k holders. Whilst I am positive you have seen Kendu either on Twitter, Reddit, Stocktwits, Coin Market Cap, Instagram or wherever else, I will still give a quick overview.&lt;br/&gt;\nKendu is over a year old with an ATH of 283 million, Kendu has went through several redistribution periods and at the time of writing has had 7 green days in a row.&lt;br/&gt;\nKendu is following the same path that Pepe, Shib and Doge created back when they ran to the billions. This process typically takes longer than a KOL based memecoin, but it has a much higher potential for returns.&lt;br/&gt;\nKendu has many IRL products and Events and they are very important for a memecoin, as it is very attractive for potential holders. Kendu&amp;#39;s IRL output is a testament to its strength, the fact that the community has managed this before Kendu has reached the billions, is nothing short of a miracle.&lt;br/&gt;\nIt is plain to see where Kendu is going, we are destined for the billions.&lt;br/&gt;\nKendu has reached 50k votes to earn a free Certik audit, the only other coin to ever do this was Pepe...&lt;br/&gt;\nThis Certik Audit gave us an A rating, which is very good!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kendu has multiple international communities incase English is not your first language:🇮🇳 India,🇪🇸 Spanish,🇦🇪 Arabic, 🇫🇷 French, 🇩🇪 German, 🇵🇹 Portuguese, 🇷🇺 Russian, 🇨🇳 Chinese, 🇯🇵 Japanese, 🇮🇩 Indonesian, 🇰🇷 Korean, 🇹🇭 Thai, 🇹🇷 Turkish, 🇿🇦 Zulu.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/508nl3bwpmre1.png?width=1116&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3fba896883d2605a6d1d86229c76033b4ac211c1\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/508nl3bwpmre1.png?width=1116&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3fba896883d2605a6d1d86229c76033b4ac211c1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IRL Products and Event&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kendu has many IRL products: Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Merch, Kendu animation, Kendu games, Kendu Gum, Kendu Creator, Kendu pendants, Kendu Beer, Kendu Video Games and Kendu Games.&lt;br/&gt;\nKendu was at Miami Art Basel, NoSleep305 was present and even created a Kendu Mural in a very busy part of Miami&lt;br/&gt;\nKendu Entertainment(ran by Ishan) is hosting Pickleball events in India, which is a very popular sport in India. This is gathering lots of traction in the Pickleball community and has been a great success so far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From India to Miami. Kendu is truly global&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Miami Music Week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Miami Music Week is kicking off and Kendu is a head sponsor of this. This is absolutely massive as around 165,000 people are expected to go. StaySeaArt, NoSleep305 and Inkstradamus are leading the charge in the Miami heat :)&lt;br/&gt;\nKendu Energy, Kendu Merch and cocktails made from Kendu Energy will be given out to the attendees of this event. This is a great opportunity for Kendu and to go in with a green chart, the sky is the limit!!!&lt;br/&gt;\nNoSleep305 were behind the iconic Kendu Mural in Miami and Inkstradamus are making the Kendu Merch. Whilst StaySeaArt designed the Kendu Cocktail Menu. They will go down in Kendu history.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4p12yrcmpmre1.png?width=1230&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e8ec7274bc653b6e41a4e6eacdd1dd6246afcba2\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/4p12yrcmpmre1.png?width=1230&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e8ec7274bc653b6e41a4e6eacdd1dd6246afcba2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kendu Creator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kendu Creator is a website created by a chad called Akabe, where you can 3d print a Kendu mask. Whilst wearing this mask, you can play drums(like Akabe), lift weights, dance, sing.... the list goes on. This is a project to get Kendu on all forms and areas of social media, this is gonna be great, soon people will be seeing drums, people singing and running all wearing a Kendu mask. This is truly a revolutionary idea and it could make Kendu viral. We also have the Akabe mask as a filter on TikTok, so you can create a TikTok video without actually printing the mask. This gives access to the Akabe mask to everyone.&lt;br/&gt;\nAkabe has mentioned the discipline that Kendu creator has brought to his life, Kendu creator has gave him a lot of discipline to practice to drums daily to improve the content he can make. Akabe says Kendu creator gives people purpose and it pushes people to become a better version of themselves whilst pushing Kendu to the top. This is wonderful and it shows the Ken-Du mentality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I cannot stress this enough, this is one of the best ideas that has came out of Kendu so far!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3cfpy0vhpmre1.png?width=720&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=380ea19bf2079f244d53758f14ffe59d9b6ff076\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/3cfpy0vhpmre1.png?width=720&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=380ea19bf2079f244d53758f14ffe59d9b6ff076&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to look for in a Memecoin and why Kendu has that&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A community is what gives memecoins value and Kendu has arguably the best community in crypto, if Shib, Doge and Pepe can accomplish the billions with far less money in the market, why can&amp;#39;t Kendu. We are at the base of the biggest AltSeason in Crypto history, we truly have the potential to 1000x and in my opinion we can 3000x. Shib went from 22 million to 22 billion in 36 days, so why can&amp;#39;t Kendu? It has already been proven that community is all you need by the 3 coins I have mentioned, so what&amp;#39;s stopping Kendu???&lt;br/&gt;\nJoin the Telegram and check out the community even if you are not a holder. We would love to have you.&lt;br/&gt;\nSkip the Frappuccino and put the money into Kendu at the minimum. This is not an opportunity you want to miss.&lt;br/&gt;\nAll the signs were there...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to sincerely wish everyone good luck for the bull run, no matter whether you are in Kendu or not :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We Don&amp;#39;t Gamble, We Work&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/\"&gt;r/KenduInu_Ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ETH: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SOL: 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BASE: 0xef73611F98DA6E57e0776317957af61B59E09Ed7&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CG: &lt;a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu\"&gt;https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nCMC: &lt;a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/\"&gt;https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

These folks are committed full-time to growing the $KENDU community.\n\nThis weekend, we're making a big splash in Miami at an event with over 150,000 attendees. We'll be handing out more than 4,000 cans of our Kendu Energy drink to keep everyone energized. At the venue is a whole boot dedicated for $KENDU where we make and handout Kendu Cocktails made with the Kendu energy drink. Really awesome stuff :)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5pg3fbos9fre1.jpg?width=1046&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=773f0761a93cbe5f5b7669c4c28111b3d282e0ad\n\nAnd speaking of products, we have so many cool items beyond just the energy drink. From Kendu Beers and Coffee to Spirits, Candy, Merch, and even Board Games, we've got something fun for everyone. I personally I like the Kendu Energy drinks the most, I'm a caffeine addict hehe.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wwhwxhbv9fre1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=744d4c2d6436ae1ff85ba3aabb8f4685dd87ea38\n\nWe have a strong marketing team working. We've hosted billboards at Times Square, SpaceX HQ in California and the list goes on.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/83aqx5lwafre1.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf57a8f87db8aa0576fdcd2c815d85b5956b784a\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1jltxrv/video/xk2ghmbyafre1/player\n\nIn terms of social media presence, Kendu has the potential to take over levels peak Shiba Inu had reached in 2021.   \nKendu can easily 1453x this year at the time of writing this post. In my opinion we can 3000x but I am a dreamer lol.\n\nI advise you to join our telegram or our subreddit, but our tg is far busier. Even if you don't hold a bag join us and check us out. Ask any questions you want, we are a very welcoming community : )  \nSkip the Five Guys and put the money into Kendu, $15 can easily become $15000.\n\nIt is your choice Anon, this is your opportunity to join a community destined to cement it's legacy in crypto history. Join the winning team, we are $KENDU.\n\nWe Don't Gamble, We Work!!!\n\n[r/KenduInu\\_Ecosystem](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/)\n\nETH: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18\n\nSOL: 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45\n\nBASE: 0xef73611F98DA6E57e0776317957af61B59E09Ed7\n\nCG: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu)  \nCMC: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)\n\n  \nThat being said.

These folks are committed full-time to growing the $KENDU community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This weekend, we&amp;#39;re making a big splash in Miami at an event with over 150,000 attendees. We&amp;#39;ll be handing out more than 4,000 cans of our Kendu Energy drink to keep everyone energized. At the venue is a whole boot dedicated for $KENDU where we make and handout Kendu Cocktails made with the Kendu energy drink. Really awesome stuff :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5pg3fbos9fre1.jpg?width=1046&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=773f0761a93cbe5f5b7669c4c28111b3d282e0ad\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/5pg3fbos9fre1.jpg?width=1046&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=773f0761a93cbe5f5b7669c4c28111b3d282e0ad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And speaking of products, we have so many cool items beyond just the energy drink. From Kendu Beers and Coffee to Spirits, Candy, Merch, and even Board Games, we&amp;#39;ve got something fun for everyone. I personally I like the Kendu Energy drinks the most, I&amp;#39;m a caffeine addict hehe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/wwhwxhbv9fre1.jpg?width=1280&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=744d4c2d6436ae1ff85ba3aabb8f4685dd87ea38\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/wwhwxhbv9fre1.jpg?width=1280&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=744d4c2d6436ae1ff85ba3aabb8f4685dd87ea38&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have a strong marketing team working. We&amp;#39;ve hosted billboards at Times Square, SpaceX HQ in California and the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/83aqx5lwafre1.jpg?width=1170&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=bf57a8f87db8aa0576fdcd2c815d85b5956b784a\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/83aqx5lwafre1.jpg?width=1170&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=bf57a8f87db8aa0576fdcd2c815d85b5956b784a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/1jltxrv/video/xk2ghmbyafre1/player\"&gt;https://reddit.com/link/1jltxrv/video/xk2ghmbyafre1/player&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In terms of social media presence, Kendu has the potential to take over levels peak Shiba Inu had reached in 2021.&lt;br/&gt;\nKendu can easily 1453x this year at the time of writing this post. In my opinion we can 3000x but I am a dreamer lol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I advise you to join our telegram or our subreddit, but our tg is far busier. Even if you don&amp;#39;t hold a bag join us and check us out. Ask any questions you want, we are a very welcoming community : )&lt;br/&gt;\nSkip the Five Guys and put the money into Kendu, $15 can easily become $15000.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is your choice Anon, this is your opportunity to join a community destined to cement it&amp;#39;s legacy in crypto history. Join the winning team, we are $KENDU.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We Don&amp;#39;t Gamble, We Work!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/\"&gt;r/KenduInu_Ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ETH: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SOL: 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BASE: 0xef73611F98DA6E57e0776317957af61B59E09Ed7&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CG: &lt;a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu\"&gt;https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nCMC: &lt;a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/\"&gt;https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That being said.

The cabal coins or the coins that were valuated much higher than their worth have since been culled with what has happened. There are fewer rugs and a lower chance of getting burned which means your odds of finding a serious committed project are up. Through this darkness there has been a select few communities that with their work have stood out and one of those to me is Kendu.\n\nAn unwavering and dedicated community that has shone through the dark market. One that has not stopped building and has kept adding holders even with eth managing to stay below 2000 for weeks on end. A community that builds when the market fear/greed index is at 10 is a community that you want to be holding when that index is at 90.\n\nIt really feels like we have seen the worst behind us now for the market in general. The bullrun will slowly turn back on in the next couple weeks to months before completely going parabolic once again to new ATHs. So then therefore now is the perfect time to position yourself in strong communities and there is simply no contender when it comes to IRL marketing like Kendu does.\n\n**Kendu recently just saw 7 days in a row of green** now with a slight cool off. Sell pressure from all the early whales that have made their way out is now gone and sat with a distribution that rivals the top memecoins in the space Kendu is perfectly set up to make a run. **Kendu has moved about 95% (as of writing) on the 7-day timeframe right now** and is showing no signs of stopping. So, with a clearly established floor and proving through the market culling that they are here to stay and dominate this cycle, it just makes sense to join in on the movement.\n\nSimply put, Kendu is a global behemoth currently larping as a 12m mc coin. There is so much alpha popping up at all times from a decentralised community of dedicated holders that it is hard to capture in one post.\n\nMany of those holders are only Kendu holders as well meaning that this is THE play for them. When you have people who hold only one coin, you have people that are completely and utterly dedicated to a cause. Remember, sustainable mindshare is perpetual. You cannot contain a decentralised community, and I am sure many of you have seen Kendu in the past. So then ask yourself - If you have been seeing Kendu continuously build and grow on the daily for over a year now, sincerely proving Kendu is never stopping, what do you think will happen when eth is ripping through new ATHs?\n\nThere is only upside.\n\nThe cope will be palpable when you see Kendu running to multibillions valuation, so buy a bag to avoid lifelong chronic pain of missing \"the one\"\n\nThis is the final play.\n\n[r/KenduInu\\_Ecosystem](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/)\n\nETH CA: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18  \nSOL CA: 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45  \nBASE CA: 0xef73611F98DA6E57e0776317957af61B59E09Ed7\n\nCG: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu)  \nCMC: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)",

So then ask yourself - If you have been seeing Kendu continuously build and grow on the daily for over a year now, sincerely proving Kendu is never stopping, what do you think will happen when eth is ripping through new ATHs?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is only upside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cope will be palpable when you see Kendu running to multibillions valuation, so buy a bag to avoid lifelong chronic pain of missing &amp;quot;the one&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the final play.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/\"&gt;r/KenduInu_Ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ETH CA: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18&lt;br/&gt;\nSOL CA: 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45&lt;br/&gt;\nBASE CA: 0xef73611F98DA6E57e0776317957af61B59E09Ed7&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CG: &lt;a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu\"&gt;https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nCMC: &lt;a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/\"&gt;https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Whilst I am positive you have seen Kendu either on Twitter, Reddit, Stocktwits, Coin Market Cap, Instagram or wherever else, I will still give a quick overview.  \nKendu is over a year old with an ATH of 283 million, Kendu has went through several redistribution periods and at the time of writing has had 7 green days in a row.  \nKendu is following the same path that Pepe, Shib and Doge created back when they ran to the billions. This process typically takes longer than a KOL based memecoin, but it has a much higher potential for returns.  \nKendu has many IRL products and Events and they are very important for a memecoin, as it is very attractive for potential holders. Kendu's IRL output is a testament to its strength, the fact that the community has managed this before Kendu has reached the billions, is nothing short of a miracle.  \nIt is plain to see where Kendu is going, we are destined for the billions.  \nKendu has reached 50k votes to earn a free Certik audit, the only other coin to ever do this was Pepe...  \nThis Certik Audit gave us an A rating, which is very good!!!\n\nKendu has multiple international communities incase English is not your first language:🇮🇳 India,🇪🇸 Spanish,🇦🇪 Arabic, 🇫🇷 French, 🇩🇪 German, 🇵🇹 Portuguese, 🇷🇺 Russian, 🇨🇳 Chinese, 🇯🇵 Japanese, 🇮🇩 Indonesian, 🇰🇷 Korean, 🇹🇭 Thai, 🇹🇷 Turkish, 🇿🇦 Zulu.\n\n**IRL Products and Event**\n\nKendu has many IRL products: Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Merch, Kendu animation, Kendu games, Kendu Gum, Kendu pendants, Kendu Beer, Kendu Video Games and Kendu Games.  \nKendu was at Miami Art Basel, NoSleep305 was present and even created a Kendu Mural in a very busy part of Miami  \nKendu Entertainment(ran by Ishan) is hosting Pickleball events in India, which is a very popular sport in India. This is gathering lots of traction in the Pickleball community and has been a great success so far.\n\nFrom India to Miami. Kendu is truly global\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/afa4o3ypr6re1.png?width=1014&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7fa41e9eb4417585ee4f732c027b4cd69f33140\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zpy2f6vrr6re1.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f02fae9743fa7f72e692e2decb1306101d8b83d9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fp9e6g4tr6re1.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51e449f35649ad268ff4485f80f367d2eca1ce46\n\n**Miami Music Week**\n\nIn 2 days Miami Music Week is kicking off and Kendu is a head sponsor of this. This is absolutely massive as around 165,000 people are expected to go. StaySeaArt, NoSleep305 and Inkstradamus are leading the charge in the Miami heat :)  \nKendu Energy, Kendu Merch and cocktails made from Kendu Energy will be given out to the attendees of this event. This is a great opportunity for Kendu and to go in with a green chart, the sky is the limit!!!  \nNoSleep305 were behind the iconic Kendu Mural in Miami and Inkstradamus are making the Kendu Merch. Whilst StaySeaArt designed the Kendu Cocktail Menu. They will go down in Kendu history.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8qj9z60vr6re1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7da8009009952b86b58fbd5447a517671dd6618d\n\n**What to look for in a Memecoin and why Kendu has that**\n\nA community is what gives memecoins value and Kendu has arguably the best community in crypto, if Shib, Doge and Pepe can accomplish the billions with far less money in the market, why can't Kendu. We are at the base of the biggest AltSeason in Crypto history, we truly have the potential to 1000x and in my opinion we can 3000x. Shib went from 22 million to 22 billion in 36 days, so why can't Kendu? It has already been proven that community is all you need by the 3 coins I have mentioned, so what's stopping Kendu???  \nJoin the Telegram and check out the community even if you are not a holder. We would love to have you.  \nSkip the Frappuccino and put the money into Kendu at the minimum. This is not an opportunity you want to miss.  \nAll the signs were there...\n\nI want to sincerely wish everyone good luck for the bull run, no matter whether you are in Kendu or not :)\n\nWe Don't Gamble, We Work\n\n[r/KenduInu\\_Ecosystem](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/)\n\nETH: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18\n\nSOL: 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45\n\nBASE: 0xef73611F98DA6E57e0776317957af61B59E09Ed7\n\nCG: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu)  \nCMC: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)",

We are entirely focused on community and have nearly 18k holders. Whilst I am positive you have seen Kendu either on Twitter, Reddit, Stocktwits, Coin Market Cap, Instagram or wherever else, I will still give a quick overview.&lt;br/&gt;\nKendu is over a year old with an ATH of 283 million, Kendu has went through several redistribution periods and at the time of writing has had 7 green days in a row.&lt;br/&gt;\nKendu is following the same path that Pepe, Shib and Doge created back when they ran to the billions. This process typically takes longer than a KOL based memecoin, but it has a much higher potential for returns.&lt;br/&gt;\nKendu has many IRL products and Events and they are very important for a memecoin, as it is very attractive for potential holders. Kendu&amp;#39;s IRL output is a testament to its strength, the fact that the community has managed this before Kendu has reached the billions, is nothing short of a miracle.&lt;br/&gt;\nIt is plain to see where Kendu is going, we are destined for the billions.&lt;br/&gt;\nKendu has reached 50k votes to earn a free Certik audit, the only other coin to ever do this was Pepe...&lt;br/&gt;\nThis Certik Audit gave us an A rating, which is very good!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kendu has multiple international communities incase English is not your first language:🇮🇳 India,🇪🇸 Spanish,🇦🇪 Arabic, 🇫🇷 French, 🇩🇪 German, 🇵🇹 Portuguese, 🇷🇺 Russian, 🇨🇳 Chinese, 🇯🇵 Japanese, 🇮🇩 Indonesian, 🇰🇷 Korean, 🇹🇭 Thai, 🇹🇷 Turkish, 🇿🇦 Zulu.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IRL Products and Event&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kendu has many IRL products: Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Merch, Kendu animation, Kendu games, Kendu Gum, Kendu pendants, Kendu Beer, Kendu Video Games and Kendu Games.&lt;br/&gt;\nKendu was at Miami Art Basel, NoSleep305 was present and even created a Kendu Mural in a very busy part of Miami&lt;br/&gt;\nKendu Entertainment(ran by Ishan) is hosting Pickleball events in India, which is a very popular sport in India. This is gathering lots of traction in the Pickleball community and has been a great success so far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From India to Miami. Kendu is truly global&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/afa4o3ypr6re1.png?width=1014&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e7fa41e9eb4417585ee4f732c027b4cd69f33140\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/afa4o3ypr6re1.png?width=1014&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e7fa41e9eb4417585ee4f732c027b4cd69f33140&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/zpy2f6vrr6re1.png?width=960&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f02fae9743fa7f72e692e2decb1306101d8b83d9\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/zpy2f6vrr6re1.png?width=960&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f02fae9743fa7f72e692e2decb1306101d8b83d9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/fp9e6g4tr6re1.png?width=960&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=51e449f35649ad268ff4485f80f367d2eca1ce46\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/fp9e6g4tr6re1.png?width=960&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=51e449f35649ad268ff4485f80f367d2eca1ce46&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Miami Music Week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2 days Miami Music Week is kicking off and Kendu is a head sponsor of this. This is absolutely massive as around 165,000 people are expected to go. StaySeaArt, NoSleep305 and Inkstradamus are leading the charge in the Miami heat :)&lt;br/&gt;\nKendu Energy, Kendu Merch and cocktails made from Kendu Energy will be given out to the attendees of this event. This is a great opportunity for Kendu and to go in with a green chart, the sky is the limit!!!&lt;br/&gt;\nNoSleep305 were behind the iconic Kendu Mural in Miami and Inkstradamus are making the Kendu Merch. Whilst StaySeaArt designed the Kendu Cocktail Menu. They will go down in Kendu history.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/8qj9z60vr6re1.png?width=1080&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7da8009009952b86b58fbd5447a517671dd6618d\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/8qj9z60vr6re1.png?width=1080&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7da8009009952b86b58fbd5447a517671dd6618d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to look for in a Memecoin and why Kendu has that&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A community is what gives memecoins value and Kendu has arguably the best community in crypto, if Shib, Doge and Pepe can accomplish the billions with far less money in the market, why can&amp;#39;t Kendu. We are at the base of the biggest AltSeason in Crypto history, we truly have the potential to 1000x and in my opinion we can 3000x. Shib went from 22 million to 22 billion in 36 days, so why can&amp;#39;t Kendu? It has already been proven that community is all you need by the 3 coins I have mentioned, so what&amp;#39;s stopping Kendu???&lt;br/&gt;\nJoin the Telegram and check out the community even if you are not a holder. We would love to have you.&lt;br/&gt;\nSkip the Frappuccino and put the money into Kendu at the minimum. This is not an opportunity you want to miss.&lt;br/&gt;\nAll the signs were there...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to sincerely wish everyone good luck for the bull run, no matter whether you are in Kendu or not :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We Don&amp;#39;t Gamble, We Work&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/\"&gt;r/KenduInu_Ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ETH: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SOL: 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BASE: 0xef73611F98DA6E57e0776317957af61B59E09Ed7&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CG: &lt;a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu\"&gt;https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nCMC: &lt;a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/\"&gt;https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
