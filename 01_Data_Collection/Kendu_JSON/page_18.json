A domino effect of the $Trump, $Melania, $libra, $greed and thousand rugs in between has created a visibly despaired and destroyed timeline.\n\nIt is then from that and the massive market capitulation we have been dealing with these last few weeks where the sentiment shift is occurring. The realisation that to have strong conviction plays and to hold for longer than 4 minutes is actually a useful investing strategy (who would have thought).\n\nMy collage above reflects some of the recent sentiment change back to strong eth communities/conviction plays that allow you to actually win in the longrun.\n\nThe game is not meant for you. It is an insiders game. Trading and rotating so constantly will ALWAYS end up in your bag getting lost, especially in markets like this.\n\nThis capitulation phase of the market has also been a necessity for the strong communities to thrive in the long run. The falsely propped up cabal coins supported by nothing but vaporware have since seen a dramatic downfall. What remains now is only true communities.\n\n**Kendu**\n\nDuring the midst of all this, Kendu stands tall. With our birthday actually being tomorrow, as of time of writing, we carry with us a year of foundation, establishment and growth. To be succinct though, I want to highlight some of the massive community achievements that have come out only over the past 4 weeks.\n\n[Sponsors](https://preview.redd.it/5lltklgnr9le1.png?width=1252&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c84fc8388a18cb69dfcf1b96efd673b64af69b91)\n\nFirstly we have a Shib OG who is spearheading the sponsorship of a 3 day art festival in Miami. This will have with it thousands of our Kendu Energy drinks handed out, various cocktails and mixers using the energy drinks, merchandise handed out, awareness made of the kendu name. This event will be attended or advertised to hundreds and thousands of people, not to mention the fact that it is being attended by literal Olympians.\n\nNext we have a Kendu Entertainment start up that is focusing on sponsoring and hosting various events throughout India. The first of many being a glow in the dark pickleball event that will have national competitors playing.\n\nSo just from two community members alone, hundreds of thousands of eyes and a genuine IRL establishment. Thousands of our drinks handed out, Merchandise roaming the streets and marketing.\n\n[Certik Audit](https://preview.redd.it/9gi1xfeor9le1.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25b9a4a76e9a05b961f5936ad9f445ef8f47fb94)\n\nNext we have been given a Certik rating at the 18th highest meme in the world. That is with a community score equal to Shibs, or higher then Pepes. So... Kendu is SAFU\n\nFollowing that:\n\n* 2 games being developed, one of which will end up on Steam\n* Comarketing from Wormhole\n* Base bridge and Sol bridge\n* Community members at OKX crypto events and other events worldwide shilling Kendu\n* An Amsterdam billboard incoming for a whole week\n* Animation crew cooking episodes\n* Kendu patches and Kendu dog tags have been made\n\nTLDR: Kendu has a sustainable mindshare of relentless work. A community that is dedicated to the decabillions, a community that has more then proven these past few weeks that horrendous markets mean nothing in our vision. We are here to stay. We are here to dominate. We are here to win.\n\nThe market is shifting back to strong communities, and Kendu is simply one of the best. Capturing huge market share this cycle for Kendu is only a matter of when, not if. This recent capitulation has proven we are here for the billions this alt season.\n\nJoin the movement and build alongside us. Build your networks, learn and springboard your wildest dreams off of the community engagement. The Kendu umbrella is on a mission to becoming global, and we would love to have you.\n\n[r/KenduInu\\_Ecosystem](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/)\n\nETH CA: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18  \nSOL CA: 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45  \nBASE CA: 0xef73611F98DA6E57e0776317957af61B59E09Ed7\n\nCG: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu)  \nCMC: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)",

A domino effect of the $Trump, $Melania, $libra, $greed and thousand rugs in between has created a visibly despaired and destroyed timeline.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is then from that and the massive market capitulation we have been dealing with these last few weeks where the sentiment shift is occurring. The realisation that to have strong conviction plays and to hold for longer than 4 minutes is actually a useful investing strategy (who would have thought).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My collage above reflects some of the recent sentiment change back to strong eth communities/conviction plays that allow you to actually win in the longrun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The game is not meant for you. It is an insiders game. Trading and rotating so constantly will ALWAYS end up in your bag getting lost, especially in markets like this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This capitulation phase of the market has also been a necessity for the strong communities to thrive in the long run. The falsely propped up cabal coins supported by nothing but vaporware have since seen a dramatic downfall. What remains now is only true communities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kendu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the midst of all this, Kendu stands tall. With our birthday actually being tomorrow, as of time of writing, we carry with us a year of foundation, establishment and growth. To be succinct though, I want to highlight some of the massive community achievements that have come out only over the past 4 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5lltklgnr9le1.png?width=1252&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c84fc8388a18cb69dfcf1b96efd673b64af69b91\"&gt;Sponsors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Firstly we have a Shib OG who is spearheading the sponsorship of a 3 day art festival in Miami. This will have with it thousands of our Kendu Energy drinks handed out, various cocktails and mixers using the energy drinks, merchandise handed out, awareness made of the kendu name. This event will be attended or advertised to hundreds and thousands of people, not to mention the fact that it is being attended by literal Olympians.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next we have a Kendu Entertainment start up that is focusing on sponsoring and hosting various events throughout India. The first of many being a glow in the dark pickleball event that will have national competitors playing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So just from two community members alone, hundreds of thousands of eyes and a genuine IRL establishment. Thousands of our drinks handed out, Merchandise roaming the streets and marketing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9gi1xfeor9le1.png?width=480&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=25b9a4a76e9a05b961f5936ad9f445ef8f47fb94\"&gt;Certik Audit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next we have been given a Certik rating at the 18th highest meme in the world. That is with a community score equal to Shibs, or higher then Pepes. So... Kendu is SAFU&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Following that:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;2 games being developed, one of which will end up on Steam&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Comarketing from Wormhole&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Base bridge and Sol bridge&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Community members at OKX crypto events and other events worldwide shilling Kendu&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;An Amsterdam billboard incoming for a whole week&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Animation crew cooking episodes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Kendu patches and Kendu dog tags have been made&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Kendu has a sustainable mindshare of relentless work. A community that is dedicated to the decabillions, a community that has more then proven these past few weeks that horrendous markets mean nothing in our vision. We are here to stay. We are here to dominate. We are here to win.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The market is shifting back to strong communities, and Kendu is simply one of the best. Capturing huge market share this cycle for Kendu is only a matter of when, not if. This recent capitulation has proven we are here for the billions this alt season.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Join the movement and build alongside us. Build your networks, learn and springboard your wildest dreams off of the community engagement. The Kendu umbrella is on a mission to becoming global, and we would love to have you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/\"&gt;r/KenduInu_Ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ETH CA: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18&lt;br/&gt;\nSOL CA: 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45&lt;br/&gt;\nBASE CA: 0xef73611F98DA6E57e0776317957af61B59E09Ed7&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CG: &lt;a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu\"&gt;https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nCMC: &lt;a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/\"&gt;https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "**What if I told you that memes are more than just internet jokes? That they are the very building blocks of culture, that have shaped the way we think, connect, and evolve?**\n\nIn my [previous article](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/comments/1iutqoj/how_to_talk_about_memecoins_even_with_skeptics/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) I touched on the way we talk about memecoins and how they are perceived. But what I didn’t explore is what a meme actually is.\n\nAnd yes, I know the title is clickbait, please forgive me I just wanted to get your attention. I hope, and believe, that this discussion will still be interesting to you.\n\nLet me follow that up with something less controversial: most people don’t fully grasp the true essence of a meme. And if they do, they rarely say it outright. The word “meme” has been hijacked by internet pop culture and reduced to viral jokes. But that is not what memes are truly about.\n\n**Memes are the cultural equivalent of genes:** ideas that evolve, replicate, and compete for survival.\n\n[A lost cause: When you invent a serious academic concept, but the world turns it into something else entirely.](https://preview.redd.it/ooi7bgafwxke1.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42e491e974ac210e284c534ccc7e886c4991a824)\n\nThe biologist and author Richard Dawkins first introduced this concept in [The Selfish Gene](https://dn790008.ca.archive.org/0/items/pdfy-RHEZa8riPwBuUyrV/The%20Selfish%20Gene.pdf) in 1976. He argued that memes, like genes, evolve in a competitive environment. Some fade into irrelevance, while others embed themselves into society so deeply that they shape entire belief systems: Religions? National identities? Political ideologies? Those all are examples of some of the strongest and most successful memes known to mankind.\n\n**So what determines whether a meme survives - or disappears?**\n\nAs mentioned, Dawkins compared memes to genes competing in an evolutionary environment. Just like genes compete in the gene pool, memes compete in the meme pool. Here, memes must meet three critical conditions to survive:\n\n1. **Longevity** – A meme must endure over time rather than fade quickly.\n2. **Fidelity** – It must retain its core identity, even as it spreads.\n3. **Fecundity/Fertility** – It should be easy to share and replicate across different mediums.\n\nMemes that meet these three criteria tend to outlast others, becoming deeply embedded in culture. But there is more to that. Dawkins proposed that **the most powerful memes act like mental parasites**—they don’t just spread, they occupy our brains. He wrote:\n\n&gt;“When you plant a fertile meme in my mind you literally parasitize my brain, turning it into a vehicle for the meme's propagation in just the way that a virus may parasitize the genetic mechanism of a host cell.” \n\n**Why do some memes take root in culture while others vanish? And how does this connect to the world we live in today?**\n\nThe answer lies in cultural shifts. Traditional communities, like religion, family structures, local social networks, are weakening. More people live in isolated environments, whether in megacities or digital spaces dominated by work and school. At the same time, self-improvement culture is on the rise. People are increasingly focused on optimizing their lives, cutting out distractions, and finding new ways to define meaning and identity.\n\n[Doing what society won’t: When you realize the meme pool is more welcoming than real life.](https://preview.redd.it/z9ye1o3iayke1.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f288ffd191c7b7dc42827975f40fd4d8e91aa5f)\n\nThis creates a vacuum. People need new communities, new belief systems, and new sources of motivation. When a meme fulfills these needs, it sticks. It doesn’t just spread, it becomes part of how people think and act. But survival isn’t just about being seen. It happens when people are drawn to something, because what people want, they strengthen and spread.\n\n**Ok, ok fine, meme pools, brain parasites, I get it. But why is this relevant for Kendu?**\n\nI argue that Kendu is a perfect response to the growing desire for self-improvement and meaningful connections. Kendu isn’t about an image of a ferocious dog/fox hybrid - it’s an idea, a way of life. A movement built on the “Can do” attitude that empowers individuals, and that’s exactly why people want to be part of it. As a result, for Kendu, survival in the meme pool isn’t random. It’s a natural result of its core “Can Do” belief system:\n\n* **Longevity** – Most crypto projects fade within months, particularly during bad market conditions. But Kendu thrives through highs and lows and is only getting stronger. Why? Because a “Can do” community doesn’t quit when markets go red, it keeps pushing forward.\n* **Fidelity** – Memes evolve naturally over time, but Kendu’s core identity doesn’t dilute, it reinforces itself. No matter how it spreads or transforms, that core \"Can do\" identity remains unchanged.\n* **Fecundity/Fertility** – The strongest memes spread organically, but Kendu doesn’t just spread - it activates people. A community built around taking initiative is naturally hardworking, engaged, and driven.\n\nAnd you and I both know this isn’t just empty talk. Ask yourself - **out of all the tokens you’ve held or seen in the past months, why is Kendu the one with a consistently active community, a strong presence on socials, and real-life initiatives - even in red markets?**\n\nThat’s not a coincidence. It’s exactly what I’ve been arguing. And I predict the market will recognize it too - because a meme like Kendu is built to survive and thrive in the meme pool.\n\n[Natural selection in action: Survival in the meme pool isn’t random.](https://preview.redd.it/4gl18ag1zxke1.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a49af40d9c439be400901476311ced78f019d63)\n\n**So what is the take home message? What's the bigger picture?**\n\n* Kendu’s survival in the meme pool isn’t random - it follows clear logic.\n* Kendu taps into a cultural shift where people seek new communities that focus on self-improvement and personal optimization.\n* Kendu isn’t a meme to just hold and watch - it’s a community people want to actively be part of.\n\nIf you’ve made it this far, I want to hear from you, because your perspective matters:\n\n***If memes are the cultural equivalent of genes, why do you think Kendu stands out in the meme pool? What makes it special to you?***",

That they are the very building blocks of culture, that have shaped the way we think, connect, and evolve?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/comments/1iutqoj/how_to_talk_about_memecoins_even_with_skeptics/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button\"&gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt; I touched on the way we talk about memecoins and how they are perceived. But what I didn’t explore is what a meme actually is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yes, I know the title is clickbait, please forgive me I just wanted to get your attention. I hope, and believe, that this discussion will still be interesting to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me follow that up with something less controversial: most people don’t fully grasp the true essence of a meme. And if they do, they rarely say it outright. The word “meme” has been hijacked by internet pop culture and reduced to viral jokes. But that is not what memes are truly about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memes are the cultural equivalent of genes:&lt;/strong&gt; ideas that evolve, replicate, and compete for survival.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ooi7bgafwxke1.png?width=750&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=42e491e974ac210e284c534ccc7e886c4991a824\"&gt;A lost cause: When you invent a serious academic concept, but the world turns it into something else entirely.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The biologist and author Richard Dawkins first introduced this concept in &lt;a href=\"https://dn790008.ca.archive.org/0/items/pdfy-RHEZa8riPwBuUyrV/The%20Selfish%20Gene.pdf\"&gt;The Selfish Gene&lt;/a&gt; in 1976. He argued that memes, like genes, evolve in a competitive environment. Some fade into irrelevance, while others embed themselves into society so deeply that they shape entire belief systems: Religions? National identities? Political ideologies? Those all are examples of some of the strongest and most successful memes known to mankind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what determines whether a meme survives - or disappears?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, Dawkins compared memes to genes competing in an evolutionary environment. Just like genes compete in the gene pool, memes compete in the meme pool. Here, memes must meet three critical conditions to survive:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longevity&lt;/strong&gt; – A meme must endure over time rather than fade quickly.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fidelity&lt;/strong&gt; – It must retain its core identity, even as it spreads.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fecundity/Fertility&lt;/strong&gt; – It should be easy to share and replicate across different mediums.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Memes that meet these three criteria tend to outlast others, becoming deeply embedded in culture. But there is more to that. Dawkins proposed that &lt;strong&gt;the most powerful memes act like mental parasites&lt;/strong&gt;—they don’t just spread, they occupy our brains. He wrote:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“When you plant a fertile meme in my mind you literally parasitize my brain, turning it into a vehicle for the meme&amp;#39;s propagation in just the way that a virus may parasitize the genetic mechanism of a host cell.” &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do some memes take root in culture while others vanish? And how does this connect to the world we live in today?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The answer lies in cultural shifts. Traditional communities, like religion, family structures, local social networks, are weakening. More people live in isolated environments, whether in megacities or digital spaces dominated by work and school. At the same time, self-improvement culture is on the rise. People are increasingly focused on optimizing their lives, cutting out distractions, and finding new ways to define meaning and identity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/z9ye1o3iayke1.png?width=1269&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7f288ffd191c7b7dc42827975f40fd4d8e91aa5f\"&gt;Doing what society won’t: When you realize the meme pool is more welcoming than real life.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This creates a vacuum. People need new communities, new belief systems, and new sources of motivation. When a meme fulfills these needs, it sticks. It doesn’t just spread, it becomes part of how people think and act. But survival isn’t just about being seen. It happens when people are drawn to something, because what people want, they strengthen and spread.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ok, ok fine, meme pools, brain parasites, I get it. But why is this relevant for Kendu?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I argue that Kendu is a perfect response to the growing desire for self-improvement and meaningful connections. Kendu isn’t about an image of a ferocious dog/fox hybrid - it’s an idea, a way of life. A movement built on the “Can do” attitude that empowers individuals, and that’s exactly why people want to be part of it. As a result, for Kendu, survival in the meme pool isn’t random. It’s a natural result of its core “Can Do” belief system:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longevity&lt;/strong&gt; – Most crypto projects fade within months, particularly during bad market conditions. But Kendu thrives through highs and lows and is only getting stronger. Why? Because a “Can do” community doesn’t quit when markets go red, it keeps pushing forward.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fidelity&lt;/strong&gt; – Memes evolve naturally over time, but Kendu’s core identity doesn’t dilute, it reinforces itself. No matter how it spreads or transforms, that core &amp;quot;Can do&amp;quot; identity remains unchanged.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fecundity/Fertility&lt;/strong&gt; – The strongest memes spread organically, but Kendu doesn’t just spread - it activates people. A community built around taking initiative is naturally hardworking, engaged, and driven.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you and I both know this isn’t just empty talk. Ask yourself - &lt;strong&gt;out of all the tokens you’ve held or seen in the past months, why is Kendu the one with a consistently active community, a strong presence on socials, and real-life initiatives - even in red markets?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That’s not a coincidence. It’s exactly what I’ve been arguing. And I predict the market will recognize it too - because a meme like Kendu is built to survive and thrive in the meme pool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4gl18ag1zxke1.png?width=500&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7a49af40d9c439be400901476311ced78f019d63\"&gt;Natural selection in action: Survival in the meme pool isn’t random.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what is the take home message? What&amp;#39;s the bigger picture?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Kendu’s survival in the meme pool isn’t random - it follows clear logic.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Kendu taps into a cultural shift where people seek new communities that focus on self-improvement and personal optimization.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Kendu isn’t a meme to just hold and watch - it’s a community people want to actively be part of.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you’ve made it this far, I want to hear from you, because your perspective matters:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;If memes are the cultural equivalent of genes, why do you think Kendu stands out in the meme pool? What makes it special to you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

A domino effect of the $Trump, $Melania, $libra, $greed and thousand rugs in between has created a visibly despaired and destroyed timeline.\n\nIt is then from that and the massive market capitulation we have been dealing with these last few weeks where the sentiment shift is occurring. The realisation that to have strong conviction plays and to hold for longer than 4 minutes is actually a useful investing strategy (who would have thought).\n\nMy collage above reflects some of the recent sentiment change back to strong eth communities/conviction plays that allow you to actually win in the longrun.\n\nThe game is not meant for you. It is an insiders game. Trading and rotating so constantly will ALWAYS end up in your bag getting lost, especially in markets like this.\n\nThis capitulation phase of the market has also been a necessity for the strong communities to thrive in the long run. The falsely propped up cabal coins supported by nothing but vaporware have since seen a dramatic downfall. What remains now is only true communities.\n\n**Kendu**\n\nDuring the midst of all this, Kendu stands tall. With our birthday actually being tomorrow, as of time of writing, we carry with us a year of foundation, establishment and growth. To be succinct though, I want to highlight some of the massive community achievements that have come out only over the past 4 weeks.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ruroelo4z1le1.png?width=1252&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51dde83303b20705555cce112d66ee60bab0bb80\n\nFirstly we have a Shib OG who is spearheading the sponsorship of a 3 day art festival in Miami. This will have with it thousands of our Kendu Energy drinks handed out, various cocktails and mixers using the energy drinks, merchandise handed out, awareness made of the kendu name. This event will be attended or advertised to hundreds and thousands of people, not to mention the fact that it is being attended by literal Olympians.\n\nNext we have a Kendu Entertainment start up that is focusing on sponsoring and hosting various events throughout India. The first of many being a glow in the dark pickleball event that will have national competitors playing.\n\nSo just from two community members alone, hundreds of thousands of eyes and a genuine IRL establishment. Thousands of our drinks handed out, Merchandise roaming the streets and marketing.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mvx5fra6z1le1.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f7214f310cbd6ab9b5e97af467227768105bfe8\n\nNext we have been given a Certik rating at the 18th highest meme in the world. That is with a community score equal to Shibs, or higher then Pepes. So... Kendu is SAFU\n\nFollowing that:\n\n* 2 games being developed, one of which will end up on Steam\n* Comarketing from Wormhole\n* Base bridge and Sol bridge\n* Community members at OKX crypto events and other events worldwide shilling Kendu\n* An Amsterdam billboard incoming for a whole week\n* Animation crew cooking episodes\n* Kendu patches and Kendu dog tags have been made\n\nTLDR: Kendu has a sustainable mindshare of relentless work. A community that is dedicated to the decabillions, a community that has more then proven these past few weeks that horrendous markets mean nothing in our vision. We are here to stay. We are here to dominate. We are here to win.\n\nThe market is shifting back to strong communities, and Kendu is simply one of the best. Capturing huge market share this cycle for Kendu is only a matter of when, not if. This recent capitulation has proven we are here for the billions this alt season.\n\nJoin the movement and build alongside us. Build your networks, learn and springboard your wildest dreams off of the community engagement. The Kendu umbrella is on a mission to becoming global, and we would love to have you.\n\n[r/KenduInu\\_Ecosystem](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/)\n\nETH CA: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18  \nSOL CA: 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45  \nBASE CA: 0xef73611F98DA6E57e0776317957af61B59E09Ed7\n\nCG: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu)  \nCMC: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)",

A domino effect of the $Trump, $Melania, $libra, $greed and thousand rugs in between has created a visibly despaired and destroyed timeline.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is then from that and the massive market capitulation we have been dealing with these last few weeks where the sentiment shift is occurring. The realisation that to have strong conviction plays and to hold for longer than 4 minutes is actually a useful investing strategy (who would have thought).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My collage above reflects some of the recent sentiment change back to strong eth communities/conviction plays that allow you to actually win in the longrun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The game is not meant for you. It is an insiders game. Trading and rotating so constantly will ALWAYS end up in your bag getting lost, especially in markets like this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This capitulation phase of the market has also been a necessity for the strong communities to thrive in the long run. The falsely propped up cabal coins supported by nothing but vaporware have since seen a dramatic downfall. What remains now is only true communities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kendu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the midst of all this, Kendu stands tall. With our birthday actually being tomorrow, as of time of writing, we carry with us a year of foundation, establishment and growth. To be succinct though, I want to highlight some of the massive community achievements that have come out only over the past 4 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ruroelo4z1le1.png?width=1252&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=51dde83303b20705555cce112d66ee60bab0bb80\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/ruroelo4z1le1.png?width=1252&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=51dde83303b20705555cce112d66ee60bab0bb80&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Firstly we have a Shib OG who is spearheading the sponsorship of a 3 day art festival in Miami. This will have with it thousands of our Kendu Energy drinks handed out, various cocktails and mixers using the energy drinks, merchandise handed out, awareness made of the kendu name. This event will be attended or advertised to hundreds and thousands of people, not to mention the fact that it is being attended by literal Olympians.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next we have a Kendu Entertainment start up that is focusing on sponsoring and hosting various events throughout India. The first of many being a glow in the dark pickleball event that will have national competitors playing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So just from two community members alone, hundreds of thousands of eyes and a genuine IRL establishment. Thousands of our drinks handed out, Merchandise roaming the streets and marketing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/mvx5fra6z1le1.png?width=480&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3f7214f310cbd6ab9b5e97af467227768105bfe8\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/mvx5fra6z1le1.png?width=480&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3f7214f310cbd6ab9b5e97af467227768105bfe8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next we have been given a Certik rating at the 18th highest meme in the world. That is with a community score equal to Shibs, or higher then Pepes. So... Kendu is SAFU&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Following that:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;2 games being developed, one of which will end up on Steam&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Comarketing from Wormhole&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Base bridge and Sol bridge&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Community members at OKX crypto events and other events worldwide shilling Kendu&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;An Amsterdam billboard incoming for a whole week&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Animation crew cooking episodes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Kendu patches and Kendu dog tags have been made&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Kendu has a sustainable mindshare of relentless work. A community that is dedicated to the decabillions, a community that has more then proven these past few weeks that horrendous markets mean nothing in our vision. We are here to stay. We are here to dominate. We are here to win.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The market is shifting back to strong communities, and Kendu is simply one of the best. Capturing huge market share this cycle for Kendu is only a matter of when, not if. This recent capitulation has proven we are here for the billions this alt season.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Join the movement and build alongside us. Build your networks, learn and springboard your wildest dreams off of the community engagement. The Kendu umbrella is on a mission to becoming global, and we would love to have you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/\"&gt;r/KenduInu_Ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ETH CA: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18&lt;br/&gt;\nSOL CA: 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45&lt;br/&gt;\nBASE CA: 0xef73611F98DA6E57e0776317957af61B59E09Ed7&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CG: &lt;a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu\"&gt;https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nCMC: &lt;a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/\"&gt;https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

A domino effect of the $Trump, $Melania, $libra, $greed and thousand rugs in between has created a visibly despaired and destroyed timeline.\n\nIt is then from that and the massive market capitulation we have been dealing with these last few weeks where the sentiment shift is occurring. The realisation that to have strong conviction plays and to hold for longer than 4 minutes is actually a useful investing strategy (who would have thought).\n\nMy collage above reflects some of the recent sentiment change back to strong eth communities/conviction plays that allow you to actually win in the longrun.\n\nThe game is not meant for you. It is an insiders game. Trading and rotating so constantly will ALWAYS end up in your bag getting lost, especially in markets like this.\n\nThis capitulation phase of the market has also been a necessity for the strong communities to thrive in the long run. The falsely propped up cabal coins supported by nothing but vaporware have since seen a dramatic downfall. What remains now is only true communities.\n\n**Kendu**\n\nDuring the midst of all this, Kendu stands tall. With our birthday actually being tomorrow, as of time of writing, we carry with us a year of foundation, establishment and growth. To be succinct though, I want to highlight some of the massive community achievements that have come out only over the past 4 weeks.\n\n[IRL sponsors](https://preview.redd.it/cdssngt4z1le1.png?width=1252&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fa5ce53486dc85f5fa5902d0f0c63ba3bbd727e)\n\nFirstly we have a Shib OG who is spearheading the sponsorship of a 3 day art festival in Miami. This will have with it thousands of our Kendu Energy drinks handed out, various cocktails and mixers using the energy drinks, merchandise handed out, awareness made of the kendu name. This event will be attended or advertised to hundreds and thousands of people, not to mention the fact that it is being attended by literal Olympians.\n\nNext we have a Kendu Entertainment start up that is focusing on sponsoring and hosting various events throughout India. The first of many being a glow in the dark pickleball event that will have national competitors playing.\n\nSo just from two community members alone, hundreds of thousands of eyes and a genuine IRL establishment. Thousands of our drinks handed out, Merchandise roaming the streets and marketing.\n\n[Certik Audit](https://preview.redd.it/tlif0qd6z1le1.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be182dfb174999c5a1edb480e2072ab570a6b181)\n\nNext we have been given a Certik rating at the 18th highest meme in the world. That is with a community score equal to Shibs, or higher then Pepes. So... Kendu is SAFU\n\nFollowing that:\n\n* 2 games being developed, one of which will end up on Steam\n* Comarketing from Wormhole\n* Base bridge and Sol bridge\n* Community members at OKX crypto events and other events worldwide shilling Kendu\n* An Amsterdam billboard incoming for a whole week\n* Animation crew cooking episodes\n* Kendu patches and Kendu dog tags have been made\n\nTLDR: Kendu has a sustainable mindshare of relentless work. A community that is dedicated to the decabillions, a community that has more then proven these past few weeks that horrendous markets mean nothing in our vision. We are here to stay. We are here to dominate. We are here to win.\n\nThe market is shifting back to strong communities, and Kendu is simply one of the best. Capturing huge market share this cycle for Kendu is only a matter of when, not if. This recent capitulation has proven we are here for the billions this alt season.\n\nJoin the movement and build alongside us. Build your networks, learn and springboard your wildest dreams off of the community engagement. The Kendu umbrella is on a mission to becoming global, and we would love to have you.\n\n[r/KenduInu\\_Ecosystem](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/)\n\nETH CA: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18  \nSOL CA: 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45  \nBASE CA: 0xef73611F98DA6E57e0776317957af61B59E09Ed7\n\nCG: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu)  \nCMC: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)",

A domino effect of the $Trump, $Melania, $libra, $greed and thousand rugs in between has created a visibly despaired and destroyed timeline.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is then from that and the massive market capitulation we have been dealing with these last few weeks where the sentiment shift is occurring. The realisation that to have strong conviction plays and to hold for longer than 4 minutes is actually a useful investing strategy (who would have thought).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My collage above reflects some of the recent sentiment change back to strong eth communities/conviction plays that allow you to actually win in the longrun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The game is not meant for you. It is an insiders game. Trading and rotating so constantly will ALWAYS end up in your bag getting lost, especially in markets like this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This capitulation phase of the market has also been a necessity for the strong communities to thrive in the long run. The falsely propped up cabal coins supported by nothing but vaporware have since seen a dramatic downfall. What remains now is only true communities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kendu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the midst of all this, Kendu stands tall. With our birthday actually being tomorrow, as of time of writing, we carry with us a year of foundation, establishment and growth. To be succinct though, I want to highlight some of the massive community achievements that have come out only over the past 4 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/cdssngt4z1le1.png?width=1252&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9fa5ce53486dc85f5fa5902d0f0c63ba3bbd727e\"&gt;IRL sponsors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Firstly we have a Shib OG who is spearheading the sponsorship of a 3 day art festival in Miami. This will have with it thousands of our Kendu Energy drinks handed out, various cocktails and mixers using the energy drinks, merchandise handed out, awareness made of the kendu name. This event will be attended or advertised to hundreds and thousands of people, not to mention the fact that it is being attended by literal Olympians.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next we have a Kendu Entertainment start up that is focusing on sponsoring and hosting various events throughout India. The first of many being a glow in the dark pickleball event that will have national competitors playing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So just from two community members alone, hundreds of thousands of eyes and a genuine IRL establishment. Thousands of our drinks handed out, Merchandise roaming the streets and marketing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/tlif0qd6z1le1.png?width=480&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=be182dfb174999c5a1edb480e2072ab570a6b181\"&gt;Certik Audit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next we have been given a Certik rating at the 18th highest meme in the world. That is with a community score equal to Shibs, or higher then Pepes. So... Kendu is SAFU&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Following that:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;2 games being developed, one of which will end up on Steam&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Comarketing from Wormhole&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Base bridge and Sol bridge&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Community members at OKX crypto events and other events worldwide shilling Kendu&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;An Amsterdam billboard incoming for a whole week&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Animation crew cooking episodes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Kendu patches and Kendu dog tags have been made&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Kendu has a sustainable mindshare of relentless work. A community that is dedicated to the decabillions, a community that has more then proven these past few weeks that horrendous markets mean nothing in our vision. We are here to stay. We are here to dominate. We are here to win.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The market is shifting back to strong communities, and Kendu is simply one of the best. Capturing huge market share this cycle for Kendu is only a matter of when, not if. This recent capitulation has proven we are here for the billions this alt season.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Join the movement and build alongside us. Build your networks, learn and springboard your wildest dreams off of the community engagement. The Kendu umbrella is on a mission to becoming global, and we would love to have you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/\"&gt;r/KenduInu_Ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ETH CA: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18&lt;br/&gt;\nSOL CA: 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45&lt;br/&gt;\nBASE CA: 0xef73611F98DA6E57e0776317957af61B59E09Ed7&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CG: &lt;a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu\"&gt;https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nCMC: &lt;a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/\"&gt;https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Portraits of the Supreme Leader hang beside those of a mysterious, chiseled man. From the loudspeakers, grand operas about Lamborghini and missing devs echo through the air.\n\nIt’s **Kendu Friendship Day**, the most unexpected [holiday in North Korean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holidays_in_North_Korea#List_of_annual_holidays) history. Just a year ago, this day was like any other. Now, it’s a full-scale celebration. But how did it happen? And what does a crypto hack have to do with it?\n\n# Origins of the Holiday\n\nPeople around the world were in shock on February 21st: $1.5 billion in ETH had been stolen from Bybit, markets plunged, and panic selling spread like wildfire. But not in North Korea. There, it was a day of joy and celebration. North Korea [obtained ](https://x.com/Medevil_Coconut/status/1893113740104474952)Kendu.\n\nTo honor this historic moment and ensure it would be celebrated for eternity, the Supreme Leader declared February 21 a national holiday: Kendu Friendship Day.\n\n# How Kendu Friendship Day Is Observed\n\nThe excitement begins as soon as the sun rises. Across the country, streets once lined with traditional propaganda are now covered in triumphant Kendu posters, celebrating the people’s faith in the memecoin that changed everything. The usual silence of the morning is replaced by music and speeches, voices booming through loudspeakers about warnings of imperialist rug pulls, the power of belief, and the inevitable mooning of Kendu.\n\n[A mother takes her daughter on a celebratory bike ride on Kendu Friendship Day.](https://preview.redd.it/q7ei7irp8xke1.png?width=1071&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ebd7179f37eb12960a967507cd5830680b90ee5)\n\nIn every home, a sacred ritual takes place. Side by side, framed pictures of the most important men are hung on living room walls: the Supreme Leader and Mike O’Hearn. On this day, and only this day, the impossible is allowed: both men and women may fantasize about someone other than the Supreme Leader.\n\nOutside, the march of the high-waisted faithful begins. In North Korea, and even in Kendu-holding communities abroad, people step onto the streets with their pants pulled impossibly high, chest puffed out as a symbol of pride and conviction. \n\n[Some traditions have spread beyond North Korea: a Kendu Chad, allegedly named Josh, observes Kendu Friendship Day somewhere in Africa, proudly wearing traditional high-waisted pants.](https://reddit.com/link/1iwgbwg/video/eghrsduxexke1/player)\n\nWork is forbidden on this day. Instead, the nation turns to its true passions. Some gather in fields and rooftops, tracking intercontinental ballistic missiles, much like plane or train spotting in the West. They marvel at their trajectory with the same excitement that traders have for a green candle on the charts, carefully noting launch angles, exhaust patterns, and estimated impact zones. It reminded me a lot of train spotters who meticulously log engine models or plane enthusiasts who track flight numbers.\n\n[Left: A North Korean woman, most likely, fantasizing about cooking breakfast bacon on Mike O’Hearn’s sizzling abs.

Traditionally, missile launches on Kendu Friendship Day are accompanied by celebratory green smoke \\(patent pending\\) for good luck.](https://preview.redd.it/d2mda8m99xke1.png?width=4214&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e8224a8428eb9cc546e5620b0277b764a69efff)\n\nOthers fill the concert halls, listening and singing along familiar tunes that have become inseparable from the holiday - songs like *\"Wen Moon?\"*, *\"Where Dev?\"*, *\"My Wife Left Me for a Fiat Maxi\"*, and the ever-haunting *\"Wen Lambo?\"*, a heart-wrenching spoken-word performance about falling for a man in the subway who only wanted your spare change, not your heart.\n\nAs the night deepens, the celebrations only become happier, louder and more colorful. Fireworks light up the sky, explosions reflecting in the eyes of those who still believe. Tomorrow, the charts may rise or fall, the markets may bless or betray - but on this day, none of that matters. Because on Kendu Friendship Day, faith is all that remains.\n\n[A performance of the popular tune \\\\\"Wen Lambo?\\\\\" at the East Pyongyang Grand Theatre.](https://preview.redd.it/vbh8qbhoaxke1.png?width=742&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e3dd7be5f7269de4b9ce76803be8d5e99893d07)\n\n# A Celebration Like No Other\n\nStanding in the middle of it all, I couldn’t help but be swept up in the energy. The music, the chants, the sheer conviction in every high-waisted marcher. It was unlike anything I had ever seen. A truly emotional and touching moment. For one day, the weight of reality didn’t matter.\n\nAs the night stretched on, I knew one thing for certain: this was only the beginning. Next year, the pants will be even higher, the voices even louder, and Mike O'Hearn even more sizzling.\n\nAnd I can’t wait to be there to witness it all again.",

It reminded me a lot of train spotters who meticulously log engine models or plane enthusiasts who track flight numbers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/d2mda8m99xke1.png?width=4214&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9e8224a8428eb9cc546e5620b0277b764a69efff\"&gt;Left: A North Korean woman, most likely, fantasizing about cooking breakfast bacon on Mike O’Hearn’s sizzling abs. Right: An ordinary North Korean family engaged in intercontinental ballistic missile spotting. Traditionally, missile launches on Kendu Friendship Day are accompanied by celebratory green smoke (patent pending) for good luck.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Others fill the concert halls, listening and singing along familiar tunes that have become inseparable from the holiday - songs like &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Wen Moon?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Where Dev?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;My Wife Left Me for a Fiat Maxi&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;, and the ever-haunting &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Wen Lambo?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;, a heart-wrenching spoken-word performance about falling for a man in the subway who only wanted your spare change, not your heart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the night deepens, the celebrations only become happier, louder and more colorful. Fireworks light up the sky, explosions reflecting in the eyes of those who still believe. Tomorrow, the charts may rise or fall, the markets may bless or betray - but on this day, none of that matters. Because on Kendu Friendship Day, faith is all that remains.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/vbh8qbhoaxke1.png?width=742&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9e3dd7be5f7269de4b9ce76803be8d5e99893d07\"&gt;A performance of the popular tune \\&amp;quot;Wen Lambo?\\&amp;quot; at the East Pyongyang Grand Theatre.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;A Celebration Like No Other&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Standing in the middle of it all, I couldn’t help but be swept up in the energy. The music, the chants, the sheer conviction in every high-waisted marcher. It was unlike anything I had ever seen. A truly emotional and touching moment. For one day, the weight of reality didn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the night stretched on, I knew one thing for certain: this was only the beginning. Next year, the pants will be even higher, the voices even louder, and Mike O&amp;#39;Hearn even more sizzling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I can’t wait to be there to witness it all again.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

              "selftext": "Hey, going to keep this post short because my intention is for any readers to discover for themselves what Kendu is through any means such as joining our telegram where you can speak to active members, browsing our subreddit ([r/KenduInu\\_Ecosystem](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/)) or looking through our X page (https://x.com/KenduInu). My goal with this is to not force what Kendu is down your throat, I want you to form your own opinion and let this serve as an introduction.\n\nOkay, moving on to the title. Recently, we have seen relentless rugging on the Solana blockchain where public figures are extracting millions upon millions of liquidity out of memecoin traders/investors. The recent Libra rug which was done by the OFFICIAL government of Argentina reached billions of volume meaning these billions were essentially stolen from us. Even in the last couple days, Dave Portnoy launched a coin called $GREED and rugged it after explicitly saying he wouldn't sell. I could go on forever but as I said, I want this post to be short.\n\nMy point is though, if you are buying memecoins lately chances are you've been incredibly rekt and lost a lot of money. Personally I have gone through many public forums such as telegram lounges, crypto twitter etc and seen a lot of people fairly upset about this and there seemingly being no light at the end of the tunnel. This will eventually lead to a mass exodus of the memecoin space leaving very little liquidity behind meaning all real projects will suffer.\n\nThis made me think... the people obviously need a saviour, but this saviour may not be in the form you might expect. Many people expect someone like Murad to come forth and lead them to salvation, which in my opinion just simply is not possible. But what if I told you that your saviour can come in the form of a huge group of people lifting each other up?\n\nWelcome to Kendu, your saviour is here. We are completely organic without any paid marketing, artificial candles on the chart and simply no bullshit. Our community members come from all around the globe and have joined forces to create this movement. Some members have already made their mark on the world through their own initiatives such as a Kendu branded energy drink, Kendu coffee, leaving stickers in public areas, making unhinged irl shilling videos and so much more.\n\nAlso very recently you have probably heard of the ByBit hack of 1.4 BILLION dollars worth of ethereum, however something that you may have missed was that the hacker owns Kendu (see their wallet in the image below). This is just something I found pretty funny and even though stealing isn’t cool, at least they have good taste in memecoins.\n\n[link to tweet: https:\\/\\/x.com\\/degeneratenews\\/status\\/1893041231627686330?s=46](https://preview.redd.it/jc7bb9zr4wke1.png?width=653&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=864fed8f303f5a5404c3074927de82b21fffd0a6)\n\nMoving on, Kendu is the saviour DeFi needs. Real people with good intentions pushing a movement.\n\nAnd with that I invite you to discover more about us as I stated at the top of the post.\n\nCMC: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)",

              "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, going to keep this post short because my intention is for any readers to discover for themselves what Kendu is through any means such as joining our telegram where you can speak to active members, browsing our subreddit (&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/\"&gt;r/KenduInu_Ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;) or looking through our X page (&lt;a href=\"https://x.com/KenduInu\"&gt;https://x.com/KenduInu&lt;/a&gt;). My goal with this is to not force what Kendu is down your throat, I want you to form your own opinion and let this serve as an introduction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Okay, moving on to the title. Recently, we have seen relentless rugging on the Solana blockchain where public figures are extracting millions upon millions of liquidity out of memecoin traders/investors. The recent Libra rug which was done by the OFFICIAL government of Argentina reached billions of volume meaning these billions were essentially stolen from us. Even in the last couple days, Dave Portnoy launched a coin called $GREED and rugged it after explicitly saying he wouldn&amp;#39;t sell. I could go on forever but as I said, I want this post to be short.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My point is though, if you are buying memecoins lately chances are you&amp;#39;ve been incredibly rekt and lost a lot of money. Personally I have gone through many public forums such as telegram lounges, crypto twitter etc and seen a lot of people fairly upset about this and there seemingly being no light at the end of the tunnel. This will eventually lead to a mass exodus of the memecoin space leaving very little liquidity behind meaning all real projects will suffer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This made me think... the people obviously need a saviour, but this saviour may not be in the form you might expect. Many people expect someone like Murad to come forth and lead them to salvation, which in my opinion just simply is not possible. But what if I told you that your saviour can come in the form of a huge group of people lifting each other up?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Kendu, your saviour is here. We are completely organic without any paid marketing, artificial candles on the chart and simply no bullshit. Our community members come from all around the globe and have joined forces to create this movement. Some members have already made their mark on the world through their own initiatives such as a Kendu branded energy drink, Kendu coffee, leaving stickers in public areas, making unhinged irl shilling videos and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also very recently you have probably heard of the ByBit hack of 1.4 BILLION dollars worth of ethereum, however something that you may have missed was that the hacker owns Kendu (see their wallet in the image below). This is just something I found pretty funny and even though stealing isn’t cool, at least they have good taste in memecoins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/jc7bb9zr4wke1.png?width=653&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=864fed8f303f5a5404c3074927de82b21fffd0a6\"&gt;link to tweet: https://x.com/degeneratenews/status/1893041231627686330?s=46&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moving on, Kendu is the saviour DeFi needs. Real people with good intentions pushing a movement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And with that I invite you to discover more about us as I stated at the top of the post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CMC: &lt;a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/\"&gt;https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

This means that anyone looking at the wallet will be FLASHED by Kendu\n\n[link to tweet: https:\\/\\/x.com\\/degeneratenews\\/status\\/1893041231627686330?s=46](https://preview.redd.it/73h6ek9kylke1.png?width=653&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0ca53ee40f123cdd3298c05b5b4d63403c73b19)\n\nLook at that... 205K views with kendu right at the forefront. Even though stealing isn’t cool, at least they have good taste in memecoins.\n\n  \nLooking at their etherscan as well:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9wb1aa1rylke1.png?width=637&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fd2576d34b848fa59b1fe50b9ae878aef585744\n\n  \nTell me with a straight face this isn't one of the funniest things that has happened in DeFi for a while. Kendu is hereby connected with the biggest crypto hack in history which all happened on Kendu's birthday. This puts a smile on my face even if the market is completely cooked right now.\n\n\n\nPeace.\n\nCMC: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)\n\n",
