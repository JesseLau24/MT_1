              "selftext": "This CTO (community takeover) is different. This is not something that happened purely because a small group of people wanted to pump their bags and make a little bit of money. This CTO was forced upon the thousands of community members where each and every one of them had something to contribute and work on. This was a true COMMUNITY take over, and not what most of you are probably used to where the CTO team ends up rugging the project again. \n\nI can further prove that this CTO won't end up in a rug through the chart:\n\n[This is NOT technical analysis, just a quick breakdown of the events of the chart](https://preview.redd.it/2mgn8zjf4che1.png?width=1160&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=202e81250d2cf4c1afc172df8e88711c3e143df4)\n\nThe chart is currently consolidating which is perfectly healthy and organic, even though it's down from the CTO highs, there's nothing to worry about as we are still well above the price before the CTO happened, which is rare to see in many other projects as the insider team usually rugs the project back down.\n\nFurthermore, the team at Kendu Inu are made entirely of volunteers (I should know, I'm a part of it) who do not get paid, allocated supply or anything. These are people who genuinely believe in Kendu and will work relentlessly to ensure that we go where we are destined for. This means that the success of Kendu does not begin and end with the CTO team, but actually on the community itself.\n\nAnd let me tell you one thing... the Kendu Inu community is one of the most relentless insane and ORGANIC armies the world of DeFi has ever seen. I would argue that this is the best and strongest communities but that would cause unnessecary fights and arguements, which this is not the time nor place for that. We have a job to do!\n\nSo rest assured knowing that Kendu Inu will succeed because the army has no signs of slowing down. This gives me and many others serious OG Shiba Inu vibes, way back before it mooned. You may think that our chart is doomed and we cannot compare to Shib simply because of our chart, but let me remind you of what Shiba Inu did before it took off into global popularity. Remember history does not repeat, but often rhymes...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aldz48su6che1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c65ed1dc2e27f4d624ba3a9e863ad14082feb2d0\n\nTo further prove the strength of our community, a long time anonymous holder (and #1 largest individual holder) of Kendu Inu with an wallet name of ausitamo.eth (wallet link: [https://etherscan.io/address/0xf37068064aba1207ab21e463ab3469aee1ba4bd9#tokentxns](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf37068064aba1207ab21e463ab3469aee1ba4bd9#tokentxns) ) recently gave 1.7b kendu to the kendu treasury! This is worth approximately $35000 USD at the time of writing this. Remember that this is a ordinary community member giving this much money to the cause! This can be seen as two big news events:\n\n\\- We have 1.7b more for the kendu development\n\n\\- We have proof that the #1 holder is a good person who only wants the success of Kendu!\n\nTransaction:\n\n[https://etherscan.io/token/0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264aa7b00ee9df6c18?a=0xf37068064aba1207ab21e463ab3469aee1ba4bd9](https://etherscan.io/token/0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264aa7b00ee9df6c18?a=0xf37068064aba1207ab21e463ab3469aee1ba4bd9)\n\n  \nThis person would not be doing this if they did not have conviction. This is no small money for anyone... it just makes me wonder why outsiders still fade us. This will be the greatest comeback story of all crypto history, and if you do not respect it now I can guarantee that you will in the future. \n\n  \n  \nAnyway, if you got one thing out of this post I want it to be that the Kendu Inu army is unmatched and relentless. There will be no stopping us and you WILL respect the army. \n\nHelmets on, woof woof.\n\nDextools: [https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0xd9f2a7471d1998c69de5cae6df5d3f070f01df9f?t=1733243346906](https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0xd9f2a7471d1998c69de5cae6df5d3f070f01df9f?t=1733243346906)\n\nCMC: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)\n\n(we have a Solana wormhole as well, we will also soon have a wormhole to the Base chain sometime this month (February))  \nSolana dexscreener:  \n[https://dexscreener.com/solana/b34pu6w8eecyrxledxbcpy5jofly3iyclapjpyiwbkmk](https://dexscreener.com/solana/b34pu6w8eecyrxledxbcpy5jofly3iyclapjpyiwbkmk)\n\n",

              "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This CTO (community takeover) is different. This is not something that happened purely because a small group of people wanted to pump their bags and make a little bit of money. This CTO was forced upon the thousands of community members where each and every one of them had something to contribute and work on. This was a true COMMUNITY take over, and not what most of you are probably used to where the CTO team ends up rugging the project again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can further prove that this CTO won&amp;#39;t end up in a rug through the chart:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/2mgn8zjf4che1.png?width=1160&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=202e81250d2cf4c1afc172df8e88711c3e143df4\"&gt;This is NOT technical analysis, just a quick breakdown of the events of the chart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The chart is currently consolidating which is perfectly healthy and organic, even though it&amp;#39;s down from the CTO highs, there&amp;#39;s nothing to worry about as we are still well above the price before the CTO happened, which is rare to see in many other projects as the insider team usually rugs the project back down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the team at Kendu Inu are made entirely of volunteers (I should know, I&amp;#39;m a part of it) who do not get paid, allocated supply or anything. These are people who genuinely believe in Kendu and will work relentlessly to ensure that we go where we are destined for. This means that the success of Kendu does not begin and end with the CTO team, but actually on the community itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And let me tell you one thing... the Kendu Inu community is one of the most relentless insane and ORGANIC armies the world of DeFi has ever seen. I would argue that this is the best and strongest communities but that would cause unnessecary fights and arguements, which this is not the time nor place for that. We have a job to do!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So rest assured knowing that Kendu Inu will succeed because the army has no signs of slowing down. This gives me and many others serious OG Shiba Inu vibes, way back before it mooned. You may think that our chart is doomed and we cannot compare to Shib simply because of our chart, but let me remind you of what Shiba Inu did before it took off into global popularity. Remember history does not repeat, but often rhymes...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/aldz48su6che1.png?width=975&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c65ed1dc2e27f4d624ba3a9e863ad14082feb2d0\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/aldz48su6che1.png?width=975&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c65ed1dc2e27f4d624ba3a9e863ad14082feb2d0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To further prove the strength of our community, a long time anonymous holder (and #1 largest individual holder) of Kendu Inu with an wallet name of ausitamo.eth (wallet link: &lt;a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xf37068064aba1207ab21e463ab3469aee1ba4bd9#tokentxns\"&gt;https://etherscan.io/address/0xf37068064aba1207ab21e463ab3469aee1ba4bd9#tokentxns&lt;/a&gt; ) recently gave 1.7b kendu to the kendu treasury! This is worth approximately $35000 USD at the time of writing this. Remember that this is a ordinary community member giving this much money to the cause! This can be seen as two big news events:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- We have 1.7b more for the kendu development&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- We have proof that the #1 holder is a good person who only wants the success of Kendu!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Transaction:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://etherscan.io/token/0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264aa7b00ee9df6c18?a=0xf37068064aba1207ab21e463ab3469aee1ba4bd9\"&gt;https://etherscan.io/token/0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264aa7b00ee9df6c18?a=0xf37068064aba1207ab21e463ab3469aee1ba4bd9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This person would not be doing this if they did not have conviction. This is no small money for anyone... it just makes me wonder why outsiders still fade us. This will be the greatest comeback story of all crypto history, and if you do not respect it now I can guarantee that you will in the future. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if you got one thing out of this post I want it to be that the Kendu Inu army is unmatched and relentless. There will be no stopping us and you WILL respect the army. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Helmets on, woof woof.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dextools: &lt;a href=\"https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0xd9f2a7471d1998c69de5cae6df5d3f070f01df9f?t=1733243346906\"&gt;https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0xd9f2a7471d1998c69de5cae6df5d3f070f01df9f?t=1733243346906&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CMC: &lt;a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/\"&gt;https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(we have a Solana wormhole as well, we will also soon have a wormhole to the Base chain sometime this month (February))&lt;br/&gt;\nSolana dexscreener:&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://dexscreener.com/solana/b34pu6w8eecyrxledxbcpy5jofly3iyclapjpyiwbkmk\"&gt;https://dexscreener.com/solana/b34pu6w8eecyrxledxbcpy5jofly3iyclapjpyiwbkmk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

If not, welcome to the play of this cycle.\n\nEarly in the days of BTC Satoshi Nakamoto declared \"It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on. If enough people think the same way, that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.\" \n\nFast forward to now, we have countries creating national reserves of BTC and worldwide adoption occurring. \n\nBecause people believed.\n\n**Community**\n\n\"What matters is that we are united in the core of the vision, being Shiba as the pure actualisation of a decentralised and perpetual community\" - Ryoshi\n\nSince the inception of BTC and the demonstration of how belief breeds success, countless examples have been witnessed, with the most notable being Shiba.\n\nThe above Ryoshi quote demonstrating the ethos of uniting a community in a common goal and allowing that belief to catch on.\n\nWe liken the conviction and \"maxi\" attitude as the factors to allow these ideas to blossom.\n\nSat now in 2025 with an imminently approaching alt season and the largest bull run ever (when eth decides to do something...) there lay so much opportunity ahead.\n\nNamely, in strong conviction plays that align with the early ethos of Shiba and BTC.\n\n**Kendu**\n\n[A movement.](https://reddit.com/link/1ii7eln/video/eay8yqa1wahe1/player)\n\nIf you have seen Kendu on this sub or in the past and faded, I invite you to reconsider.\n\nWatch the above video and know that Kendu is one that represents the same ethos as those early days of BTC and Shiba.\n\nOne that is dedicated to creating a perpetual and decentralised movement.\n\n**Just in case it catches on**\n\nAs MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor says \"If BTC isnt going to zero, then its going to a million\"\n\nwell the same can be likened to Kendu. We have grown every day since inception, are decentralised and not governed by any singular person, representing the core ethos of what Shiba did. Basically \"If Kendu isnt going to zero, then its going to billions\" and we have proven just this through our 11+ months of proof of life. We have proven so by our daily holder ATHs and continuous foundation development.\n\nIt's just the most insane organic social movement filled with unlimited talent and connections with everything it takes to capture serious market share this cycle. The Kendu attitude is infectious with the ferocious dog representing the unlimited tenacity of the community. \n\nThe core community all share the same vision, adding new people to the core beliefs day in and day out. A community that will never stop until it succeeds on a scale we all envision it to.  It's a matter of time and work, and we absolutely will not stop. \n\nThe truth is that many wish they got in on BTC or Shiba early before they flew. It is easy to say now well I definitely would have bought that if I could go back. Holding on to Shiba at 100k mcap or BTC at $10. But would you have during those early days?\n\nSo then, I ask you to look at the spiritual successor to Shiba. It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on. If enough people think the same way, that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\n\\-----\n\nETH CA: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18  \nSOL CA: 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45\n\nCG: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu)  \nCMC: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)",

If not, welcome to the play of this cycle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Early in the days of BTC Satoshi Nakamoto declared &amp;quot;It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on. If enough people think the same way, that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to now, we have countries creating national reserves of BTC and worldwide adoption occurring. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because people believed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What matters is that we are united in the core of the vision, being Shiba as the pure actualisation of a decentralised and perpetual community&amp;quot; - Ryoshi&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since the inception of BTC and the demonstration of how belief breeds success, countless examples have been witnessed, with the most notable being Shiba.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The above Ryoshi quote demonstrating the ethos of uniting a community in a common goal and allowing that belief to catch on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We liken the conviction and &amp;quot;maxi&amp;quot; attitude as the factors to allow these ideas to blossom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sat now in 2025 with an imminently approaching alt season and the largest bull run ever (when eth decides to do something...) there lay so much opportunity ahead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Namely, in strong conviction plays that align with the early ethos of Shiba and BTC.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kendu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/1ii7eln/video/eay8yqa1wahe1/player\"&gt;A movement.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have seen Kendu on this sub or in the past and faded, I invite you to reconsider.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Watch the above video and know that Kendu is one that represents the same ethos as those early days of BTC and Shiba.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One that is dedicated to creating a perpetual and decentralised movement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just in case it catches on&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor says &amp;quot;If BTC isnt going to zero, then its going to a million&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;well the same can be likened to Kendu. We have grown every day since inception, are decentralised and not governed by any singular person, representing the core ethos of what Shiba did. Basically &amp;quot;If Kendu isnt going to zero, then its going to billions&amp;quot; and we have proven just this through our 11+ months of proof of life. We have proven so by our daily holder ATHs and continuous foundation development.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just the most insane organic social movement filled with unlimited talent and connections with everything it takes to capture serious market share this cycle. The Kendu attitude is infectious with the ferocious dog representing the unlimited tenacity of the community. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The core community all share the same vision, adding new people to the core beliefs day in and day out. A community that will never stop until it succeeds on a scale we all envision it to.  It&amp;#39;s a matter of time and work, and we absolutely will not stop. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The truth is that many wish they got in on BTC or Shiba early before they flew. It is easy to say now well I definitely would have bought that if I could go back. Holding on to Shiba at 100k mcap or BTC at $10. But would you have during those early days?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So then, I ask you to look at the spiritual successor to Shiba. It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on. If enough people think the same way, that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-----&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ETH CA: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18&lt;br/&gt;\nSOL CA: 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CG: &lt;a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu\"&gt;https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nCMC: &lt;a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/\"&gt;https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

If enough people think the same way, that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.\"\n\nFast forward to now, we have countries creating national reserves of BTC and worldwide adoption occurring.\n\nBecause people believed.\n\n**Community**\n\n\"What matters is that we are united in the core of the vision, being Shiba as the pure actualisation of a decentralised and perpetual community\" - Ryoshi\n\nSince the inception of BTC and the demonstration of how belief breeds success, countless examples have been witnessed, with the most notable being Shiba.\n\nThe above Ryoshi quote demonstrating the ethos of uniting a community in a common goal and allowing that belief to catch on.\n\nWe liken the conviction and \"maxi\" attitude as the factors to allow these ideas to blossom.\n\nSat now in 2025 with an imminently approaching alt season and the largest bull run ever (when eth decides to do something...) there lay so much opportunity ahead.\n\nNamely, in strong conviction plays that align with the early ethos of Shiba and BTC.\n\n**Kendu**\n\n[A movement](https://reddit.com/link/1ii7eoq/video/36m625egxahe1/player)\n\nIf you have seen Kendu on this sub or in the past and faded, I invite you to reconsider.\n\nWatch the above video and know that Kendu is one that represents the same ethos as those early days of BTC and Shiba.\n\nOne that is dedicated to creating a perpetual and decentralised movement.\n\n**Just in case it catches on**\n\nAs MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor says \"If BTC isnt going to zero, then its going to a million\"\n\nwell the same can be likened to Kendu. We have grown every day since inception, are decentralised and not governed by any singular person, representing the core ethos of what Shiba did. Basically \"If Kendu isnt going to zero, then its going to billions\" and we have proven just this through our 11+ months of proof of life. We have proven so by our daily holder ATHs and continuous foundation development.\n\nIt's just the most insane organic social movement filled with unlimited talent and connections with everything it takes to capture serious market share this cycle. The Kendu attitude is infectious with the ferocious dog representing the unlimited tenacity of the community.\n\nThe core community all share the same vision, adding new people to the core beliefs day in and day out. A community that will never stop until it succeeds on a scale we all envision it to.  It's a matter of time and work, and we absolutely will not stop.\n\nThe truth is that many wish they got in on BTC or Shiba early before they flew. It is easy to say now well I definitely would have bought that if I could go back. Holding on to Shiba at 100k mcap or BTC at $10. But would you have during those early days?\n\nSo then, I ask you to look at the spiritual successor to Shiba. It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on. If enough people think the same way, that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\n\\-----\n\nETH CA: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18  \nSOL CA: 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45\n\nCG: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu)  \nCMC: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/)",

We must keep pushing to distinguish ourselves from others in this market because this is when the \"competition\" goes dead quiet. So, it's an opportunity for us to be the loudest! Remember, volatility in crypto can work in both directions, and Kendu isn't going anywhere. We have a long cycle ahead of us, and what we do now matters.\n\nI recently recorded an unscripted interview with Crypto Rich to discuss Kendu and its future. I hope you enjoy it!  \n  \n[https://x.com/KenduInu/status/1886362415761404340](https://x.com/KenduInu/status/1886362415761404340)",

We must keep pushing to distinguish ourselves from others in this market because this is when the &amp;quot;competition&amp;quot; goes dead quiet. So, it&amp;#39;s an opportunity for us to be the loudest! Remember, volatility in crypto can work in both directions, and Kendu isn&amp;#39;t going anywhere. We have a long cycle ahead of us, and what we do now matters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I recently recorded an unscripted interview with Crypto Rich to discuss Kendu and its future. I hope you enjoy it!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://x.com/KenduInu/status/1886362415761404340\"&gt;https://x.com/KenduInu/status/1886362415761404340&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
