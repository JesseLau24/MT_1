I've been here since May, and even though I've never promoted FUD and have fought tooth and nail to defend this project in public spaces, I'll also be the first to admit that it's more than okay to find a near 30% drop in value over a 24-hour period to be a scary and concerning piece of news.\n\nBut I'm not here to write this post because I'm worried about losing a gamble. I'm here to get to work - and I need your help. \n\nFor those of us who were here near or at the ATH, it's no secret that this community was at its best and brightest when we were organizing as a unit and exploring opportunities to promote Kendu creatively - with Miazaki acting as a force to steer those ideas into place instead of creating new ones from scratch and telling us to sit tight for updates. I have to give massive props to this Josh guy for stepping up and representing all of us externally - but as someone who does marketing strategy for a living, I'm aware, even as a total nobody, that someone in Josh's position is always going to be in an overwhelming and uncertain place until he knows with certainty what we should be aiming at and how we plan to measure our success in that attempt. \n\nThat's why I want to open this thread - to give those of us who have concrete ideas a place to discuss, deliberate, and organize without all of the noise of the TG chat and built-in conflict that comes with sharing either a completely new or previously rejected idea. Above all else, we're ultimately a project trying to manifest its success by being inevitable - by fighting for that success on grit and sheer force of will as one team of chads and chadettes. Even if it's new territory, having the community democratically build a unified vision of what we're all working for feels exceptionally fitting for us. \n\nI'm going to submit some ideas into this thread and welcome others to do the same - once we have a full strategy I'd like to take some time and formally write it up to present to Josh and the TG chat for consensus. If you're with me - I personally cannot wait to see what you have in mind. \n\nLFG. ",
