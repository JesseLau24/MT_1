That was the reference to the ""journey""  Some memecoins have a core value like an utility, making unique memes and some have nothing but the thumbnail on coingecko. Kendu's core value is ""We don't gamble, we work"". People who joined did it because they want to believe in it and do their part. People who don't believe in it just skip the project and continue scrolling  It is because a community member did their part / work that you notice Kendu and left a comment   Even in real life, we can't expect to do nothing and get rich unless we got lucky  I still hope that your investments do well this cycle and that you find the hidden gem that will make you rich",11,1740159807.0,2025-02-21 17:43:27
1iurgi2,Bright-Tangerine1693,Guy no need to be so negative especially when you are not even in the KENDU community.  You have to look into before you submit your opinions.  People are doing irl stuff to promote $KENDU.  https://preview.redd.it/yczrlqeb3jke1.jpeg?width=1252&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=01d2c5a4e1342ff72d72f55f56eeb548d3d73d4d,8,1740159400.0,2025-02-21 17:36:40
