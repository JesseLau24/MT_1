1iwgbwg,phi_curious,"if you can you should try to go next year. the songs were beautiful, ""*My Wife Left Me for a Fiat Maxi""* was quite remarkable as a story.",18,1740335298.0,2025-02-23 18:28:18
1iwgbwg,phi_curious,The energy was unlike anything I have ever seen before. Everybody was so happy and proud that their country finally had some Kendu.,15,1740335341.0,2025-02-23 18:29:01

1iwgbwg,phi_curious,It was touching. Usually the locals are shy and stick to themselves. But on Kendu Friendship Day they invited me to their homes and a few even took me to their favorite locations for ballistic missile spotting.,9,1740340872.0,2025-02-23 20:01:12
1iwgbwg,phi_curious,Thank you! Happy you enjoyed  :) Took me a while to make all these pics. The woman cycling with all the propaganda pics was maybe a bit too much lol,5,1740350942.0,2025-02-23 22:49:02

1iw1ofi,TheGDC33,Are you talking about the KENDU to TG? That channel has been dead for a couple weeks or so. Back in the OG TG. What is your name and I can check and get you in if you were banned or muted previously,8,1740285540.0,2025-02-23 04:39:00

1iw1ofi,platniumperson,Not CTO chat. I‚Äôm in OG chat but can‚Äôt send messages. Another mod tried to fix it but couldn‚Äôt. Wondering who else is in the same situation.,6,1740286936.0,2025-02-23 05:02:16
1iw1ofi,Potlimitcrypto,At this point I'm fairly certain Telegram uses it as an aggressive method to get people to buy premium. It seems completely random.,3,1740362820.0,2025-02-24 02:07:00

1iw1ofi,TheGDC33,Sorry I get no notifications sign in app anymore and have to check the damn spot myself. I forget a lot still. Glad others gave you an answer even if it does suck. Hopefully you are free soon,3,1740354631.0,2025-02-23 23:50:31

1iw1ofi,Potlimitcrypto,It does indeed suck! You can overcome it by buying Telegram premium. It's pretty cheap.,7,1740291559.0,2025-02-23 06:19:19
