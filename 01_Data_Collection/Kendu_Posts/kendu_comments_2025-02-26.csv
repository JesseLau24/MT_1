1iyln7n,TheGDC33,I see your comment time and you would do well to check the post time. This was hours ago and the little rally happened yesterday afternoon/evening if I remember correctly and it held into when I woke up and did the metrics...then blue chips 'shit the bed' and well🤷‍♂️.

1iygepm,Exciting-Wear3872,"I can actually tell you, when we get an actual alt season.  People havent forgotten about us, theres a lot of memecoins that I follow whose volume actually almost goes to zero and people forget but as soon as theres an altcoin uptick our volume comes rushing back and our price also goes up.  Look at the small pump yesterday, we def felt the effect of that.  So when alt season comes around, whenever that is, we're going up. Not all memecoins will float when alt season comes around but given our volume compared to other coins that looked good a few months ago, no shade but r/snoofi for example, our volume always comes back, people know about us and when the market is good, we're good.",14,1740568571.0,2025-02-26 11:16:11
1iygepm,zeus109,"You have to think this way, you already are down 83% so ask yourself is selling it right now really worth it? If you already are this patient and still hopeful then please stay here for some months. Kendu Inu will go up regardless. The reason why everything is down including Kendu is because of the events that are taking place in the world right now. You heard the saying “show me the charts and i'll tell you the news”. Keep your head up and cool and see the  bigger picture. This the reason why always a small hand of people will make it in crypto every single bullmarket.

1iygepm,Unique_Opposite2026,"If you are able to then DCA. This not only helps you to lower the average cost of your token, i.e. you will break even sooner, but also helps the community by having more buys (demand for the token increase). My average purchase was 75 M MC end of last year. Now I’m at average purchase MC of <40 M and still buy when I can.  I was always planning to increase my bag, now is the time.

1iygepm,p0tatemoon,"If he believes Kendu will rise up again (core value haven't changed, great things happened: audit, KYC, CTO, events coming up, products, etc) then DCA is a good option.

1iygepm,phi_curious,Why would DCA be bad?  If you believe Kendu will rise again then buying more means your average cost will go down and you will break even earlier.
