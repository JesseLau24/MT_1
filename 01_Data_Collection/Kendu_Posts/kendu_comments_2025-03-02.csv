1j1rttl,they_call_me_mr_mac,Smash every Kendu post. Talk about Kendu to everyone that even seems the least interested in Crypto. Maybe print businesscards or stickers to spread the Kendu love.  https://preview.redd.it/8aiwvdrexame1.jpeg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4b30fde6b49d56b7c5259931c57209c8297c4ab9,11,1740932253.0,2025-03-02 16:17:33

1j1rttl,p0tatemoon,"I was in the same boat. Didn't do anything to help Kendu for months and when I saw the CTO happening and how everyone got together, I wanted to put my share of effort too  You can start by smashing the pinned post on the TG and the daily upvote (coingecko, coinmarketcap, certik, etc).

On top of that, I'm sticking Kendu stickers everywhere, making signs to hang in public areas, and figuring out ways that I can put my skills and hobbies to work for kendu!

1j1rttl,tokenKDN,"Firstly, every member is a great community member at Kendu. For what you can do, start small and regular, posting, liking, upvoting comments, voting on initiatives.

1j1rttl,TheGDC33,"Glad you are ready to put the 🪖 and get after it. Find people in real life to get a bag. If you understand the vision and believe it should be easy to share that passion. Spreading the movement IRL is probably the most important way. I got my own father in recently. Not sure why I wasn't ready to before, but I think this low range feels like a real bottom for sure and it made it easier (I did tell him he wasn't allowed to track Kendu as he is ready for this wild swings...I barely am)",9,1740938793.0,2025-03-02 18:06:33
