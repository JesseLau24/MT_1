1j2iwba,phi_curious,"Great question, I didnt even think so far.  Only option I see for reddit are profile pics. Because user names that show up in the posts are not editable.  We also would have to agree on something that we all can do, like the fox and helmet on X. So either an orange background that slaps, or adding a helmet like this one.     EDIT: or if we can make a customizable reddit avatar that is free to use. Anyone knows if we have done something like that? I dont like it as much, because there is just something special about seeing your current pic in a new version. Just sharing ideas.  https://preview.redd.it/liv4f64rehme1.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=16015559174b4f8c0dc505e0719e61874c39d006",17,1741010772.0,2025-03-03 14:06:12
