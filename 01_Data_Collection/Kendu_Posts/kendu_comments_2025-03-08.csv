1j61w6u,p0tatemoon,"This is like a coach speach in the locker room right before going for the final match. Goddamn I feel hype let's gooooooo!!!  Gotta work to earn. This is the year, this is the time that all the work together will count. Leave your mark, be part of Kendu history ✊️",24,1741387993.0,2025-03-07 22:53:13
1j61w6u,TheGDC33,>Getting involved is investing. Doing nothing is the actual gamble.  This is one of the phrases that jumped out at me and resonates with me. This applies to anyone with a bag. Get involved and take your future into your own hands by working! KENDU is our canvas now paint and make yourself successful.   This is a wonderful read!,22,1741389383.0,2025-03-07 23:16:23
1j61w6u,Both-Flow322,"Just wanted to share what’s on my mind: As I found out about this sub I immediately got catched by the sheer „We“ understanding that every active contributor has. It’s something unique. I immediately felt welcome, even though I am/was a silent reader as this is my first comment ever in this sub.  Soooo long story short im waiting for kendu energy to finally ship to germany 👀  stay stronk and we ken du it! 🫶🪖",18,1741393827.0,2025-03-08 00:30:27

1j61w6u,hyde719,"I can’t even keep track of how many KOL posts I see everyday who literally copy and paste the same verbatim day in and out. My engagement on their posts are always ignored. Kendu really stands out because every person shilling has only one agenda—running it up. Real recognizes real, and it is becoming clearer by the day who believes in our mission and who is only there to profit along the way.",13,1741407146.0,2025-03-08 04:12:26

1j61w6u,13557126,"I had my money in many “safer” investments and was doing pretty good. I have a very stable job, pretty good salary, and fairly Okay disposable income. I put all my money in $Kendu over a period of time starting last May. This was an opportunity that I couldn’t afford to miss. The risk vs reward was too high. Do I sometimes have doubts? Of course, we all do. However, that feeling of when it’s green is more powerful. We are inevitable. Even back to ATH is a 25x and with what we have built and continuing to build giving up now would be more than stupid. They always say very few people stay on the ride to the top which is true. The markets shafted everyone but that was temporary and our time will come but opportunities like this likely won’t.",5,1741450026.0,2025-03-08 16:07:06

1j61w6u,phi_curious,Looks like that one is a bigger operation than TG jail. Only Kendu as a community can free us from that prison without bars 🧡,5,1741441658.0,2025-03-08 13:47:38
