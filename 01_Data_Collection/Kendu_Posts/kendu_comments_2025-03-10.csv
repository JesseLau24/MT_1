1j7vqrg,North-Town4883," My Metrics man 🤝   Let's be honest we looking good considering,  though I'm kendu through and through and a tad bias    I suggest if pepole are a little down go look at other communities,  they down just as bad % wise if not more and the vibes are not short of , where's the rope ,    This community is built differently ",4,1741627534.0,2025-03-10 17:25:34
1j7vqrg,TheGDC33,Yeah it is promising from a community standpoint. At some point we will all look back and laugh at how shitty the market was and how much fear was around and the green rocket party it turned into. When that will happen though I must admit I have no confident estimate. I am hoping later this year 🤞 and not longer,4,1741631536.0,2025-03-10 18:32:16

1j7u7pa,RegardedQt314,not to get to into PvP but it's funny when i see these polls with us now winning when before im pretty sure we lost to a couple of the other coins on this poll.  that community grind fades so fast with others if they are not seeing green consistently.  Kendu really does stand alone and is so consistent with the output and positive sentiment no matter what.  that's an obvious sign to me that the long term is valued highly in the Kendu community 🔥,3,1741647276.0,2025-03-10 22:54:36
1j7s0s0,insegniah1,"Goal is to just outpace the sellers  More buy volume then sell volume = price go up  We are just getting out the last couple very early whales and sell pressure is massively easing  Where we are now in MC is a good capitulation zone in where believers get cheap kendu and sellers go through it quickly  The other factor is just how dead the market is, its gard to extract volume from eth considering the gwei hasnt been above 1 in over a month  All we got to do is keep working and accumulating in the meantime, and there will come a day that sell pressure is gone and we have a leg up  That could be tomorrow, next week, next month  Crypto is a matter of patience",23,1741587805.0,2025-03-10 06:23:25
