1j8wb7c,phi_curious,"Nice article Lorniko, basically what you describe is a decentralized crypto-powered franchise/brand 😁 i need to process my thoughts a bit more and then come back and comment again.",13,1741714615.0,2025-03-11 17:36:55
1j8wb7c,TheGDC33,"Kenducreator.com has to mentioned here...not my thing and only shared in the TG like an hour or so ago, but a phenomenal initiative including a KENDU creator mask. Check it out, this is very real",13,1741715685.0,2025-03-11 17:54:45
1j8wb7c,AdventOfWonder,I’ve always wanted to start a business and kendu was my avenue for doing that and learning the ropes. It’s an honor to have such an amazing community backing our products and driving brand awareness!,9,1741731019.0,2025-03-11 22:10:19

1j8wb7c,TheTruth116,Seems like a copyright infringement nightmare,2,1741714808.0,2025-03-11 17:40:08
1j8wb7c,diablero_T,"The website is beautiful, very well done whichever Chad/Chadette is responsible!  🧡🖤🦊🪖",9,1741717357.0,2025-03-11 18:22:37
1j8wb7c,lorniko,You got all my attention 👀😁,5,1741779292.0,2025-03-12 11:34:52
1j8wb7c,phi_curious,"How so? Feel free to elaborate. I am not quite sure which direction you are thinking, but neither are any copyrights required nor is it unusual for different businesses to sell their product with a common label.",9,1741716531.0,2025-03-11 18:08:51
1j8wb7c,CoopVelociraptor,"The Kendu IP is CC0 - nobody can file a TM or Copyright it and everyone is free to use it, including for profit.",4,1741778858.0,2025-03-12 11:27:38
1j8wb7c,TheTruth116,It just takes one person to copyright the name Kendu then every person who uses it regardless of their business will get sued. Just don’t see this ending well,1,1741719056.0,2025-03-11 18:50:56
1j8wb7c,phi_curious,"That isn't how copyright/trademarks work, or lets say it highly depends on the jurisdictional context. In the end everybody who starts a business needs to know for themselves what kind of legal protection they deem necessary. Imho that has nothing to with us as ""Kendu on ETH (and base and sol)""",8,1741725071.0,2025-03-11 20:31:11
1j8wb7c,lorniko,"I just checked. To copyright a brand in a majority of countries it can cost more than 100k $ per year, it depends on how many countries your target. Moreover, you register in each world region, you protect it worldwide that simple.  And even if someone had 100k$ to pay each year to copyright ""kendu"", then ""kendu energy"" ""kendu coffee"" etc aren't under copyright.  So, it is quite safe.",8,1741727827.0,2025-03-11 21:17:07
1j8wb7c,CHARLIEFORTHEBOYS,At this point you would not be able to trademark the kendu name and logo based on the fair use of it the past year,5,1741745300.0,2025-03-12 02:08:20
1j8srm7,Hot-Raspberry2758,Would have been easier to just have 1 option that everyone can just click on...Kendu 😄 🤣,4,1741745027.0,2025-03-12 02:03:47
