1jan05c,phi_curious,That would be really interesting. And also could be motivational. Don‚Äôt know anything about how hard the data processing is. But do you think one could correlate the MC with activity? Because we all feel how the heat turns up when the charts get a bit of green. Would be cool to see.,8,1741908586.0,2025-03-13 23:29:46
1jan05c,UrbanPKMonkey,For now I want to improve the summaries to make sure it captures the conversations properly. There is a lot of GPT prompt work still to do,2,1741942022.0,2025-03-14 08:47:02

Just be aware that for some reason I found DexScreener usually inflates the amount of holders which is confirmed on Etherscan often (best and most accurate numbers for ETH).
