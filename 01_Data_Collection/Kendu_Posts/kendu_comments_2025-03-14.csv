1jb9pt0,phi_curious,Question: did you do stuff like this before? Or was kendu the special motivation to push you over the edge to do it for the first time?,2,1742027919.0,2025-03-15 08:38:39
1jb9pt0,phi_curious,That sounds off. Ngl. But obviously depends on the exact time frame. When i search feet manually in TG it‚Äôs been mentioned over 30 times yesterday and today.,3,1741975646.0,2025-03-14 18:07:26

1jb9pt0,phi_curious,"hmm interesting, i guess it make sense whenever the cut off was. We can do better. Even though I dont think there was much talk about ""J33ting"" at all, so probably it is a mix between limitations of chat gpt and when the cut off was.",4,1741977472.0,2025-03-14 18:37:52

1jazqsr,TheGDC33,I will definitely not be giving you financial advice though I do believe in our community and Kendu. You have to make this decision yourself even if I do like the way you're thinking!   What I can say is that we are all responsible for making the good moves happen even yourself. We all have a role to play to propel this project forward and spread it far and wide.,25,1741950951.0,2025-03-14 11:15:51
1jazqsr,Honos11,What other alts do you hold?  I love Kendu but as they say you don't actually lose till you sell.  So I wouldn't sell alts that one can reasonably believe will recover at some point.  But that's just me.,21,1741950721.0,2025-03-14 11:12:01
1jazqsr,p0tatemoon,"if you are invested in a lot of alts, you might want to chose those that you really believe in and that have the potential to go back up again  Personally, I would recommend diversifying a bit instead of having all your eggs in one basket  Like the others said, it will be your decision to make",14,1741956134.0,2025-03-14 12:42:14

1jazqsr,insegniah1,"Not that this should in any way make your decision for you or try and encourage it -  But many of us here are 100% in kendu. Myself included.  Thats actually why im so confident on this project too, as so many holders are completely dedicated to kendu. Being 100% in means people give it their all.  Of course you make what decisions are best for you, but what you are suggesting isnt on the realm of ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù and is actually what many of us already do :)",7,1742020897.0,2025-03-15 06:41:37
