1jctmw9,Jesus092395,Are those zero sugar?,3,1742162201.0,2025-03-16 21:56:41
1jctmw9,bigboydesomo,It's awesome tasting   I compare it with redbull but less sugar and honestly the first can was ok but the second one was so good I will change to it now. I feel better and the taste after drinking these are perfect.    The taste is unique good its hard to describe.,5,1742156430.0,2025-03-16 20:20:30

1jcso1l,TheGDC33,"Great job with the work. I have to say it is probably easiest and gets the most notice (this is what I have been told about the X algorithm and maybe all socials algorithms) that we need to do a reply chain to get notice. I had to scroll to find your reply (which I had already liked, reposted and bookmarked earlier) which many people won't do. We want to show up in force.   Feel free to check in the TG with someone to confirm if what I am saying is best for the algorithm. My suggestion is include your reply in the post for those who mostly scroll Reddit, but do a little X. Makes it way way easier  https://x.com/Skillmattic1/status/1901345494233665901",5,1742167929.0,2025-03-16 23:32:09
