1je2h3m,Imbetow,Where are going to 0? :(,3,1742310429.0,2025-03-18 15:07:09
1je2h3m,TheGDC33,Agreed with volume over 1 million or more,15,1742297827.0,2025-03-18 11:37:07
1je2h3m,phi_curious,"Why do you think so?   Community has been sticking together, building a lot of things that will be essential during alt season and isn’t panicking while others are speaking of crypto doomsday.  kendu has bern trending regularly in the past few weeks, BECAUSE we have been working our butts off. We KNOW where we are going during alt season - and it aint going to be 0.",7,1742313157.0,2025-03-18 15:52:37
1je2h3m,TheGDC33,Well if a number of us didn't sell at the top why sell now. Job isn't done and it can't d Go to zero then,4,1742315248.0,2025-03-18 16:27:28
1je2h3m,Lalph-Rauren,"With such a negative attitude there are other possibilities as well, like a meteorite hitting the earth wiping us all out. Or another world war where we reach full armageddon.   Just try to look at yourself as in individual and think, what can I do in this situation. Not even considering $KENDU, just as a whole in life.  Focus on growth, focus on output, focus on the positives. That’s what counts in my opinion. Don’t yap about “sell-pressure” when the market is going sideways for weeks.  Complaining gets you nowhere in life.  Taking action and going forward will.  May I ask, why do you think we are going to 0?",7,1742311787.0,2025-03-18 15:29:47
