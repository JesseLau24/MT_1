1jj17di,phi_curious,"Easy answer is: more buy pressure, than sell pressure.  It‚Äôs a combination of factors why that is the case: we had one bigger whale selling for a few months and this whale slowed down (and afaik sold most he was holding originally), so less sell pressure. Also, some events may create new buy pressure, ie we have a big event coming up in Miami and that will probably bring in people already (connections that are made during organization, radio advertisements for the event, etc.",51,1742848829.0,2025-03-24 20:40:29
1jj17di,tokenKDN,"Yep two key reasons, 1) sell pressure is now virtually gone which was a key reason it was as low as it was, and 2) a fucking tireless, diamond handed, elite community working hard every single day with ideas and IRL initiatives.

1jj17di,Potlimitcrypto,Not everything is up 80% on the week. It is the relentless work and effort of the Kendu community that has caused buying pressure to overtake selling by $70k on the weekly volume.   Crazy how small that number is in the grand scheme of things. Goes to show the power of holding. More supply in the hands of strong holders/contributors means we can start teleporting upwards.
