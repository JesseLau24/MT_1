1jjh2pc,Scuttlefuzz,"Yes and no. If we can stay above 20m then we are above the downtrend going back to June (log scale) which is pretty significant and almost within reach. The down trend has been happening for a very long time. When we get to 60m I hope we blast through it, once that happens even a monkey can look at the chart and see that it's a buy",9,1742915674.0,2025-03-25 15:14:34

1jjh2pc,Scuttlefuzz,"I'm cautiously optimistic. But if we are going to talk about trends then let's call it like it is. We've been in a downtrend for almost a year and a consequence of that is a low target to break the trend. Breaking a trend doesn't signify any sort of ath/ price targets, only that things are now different. Work as always 🪖",9,1742918094.0,2025-03-25 15:54:54
