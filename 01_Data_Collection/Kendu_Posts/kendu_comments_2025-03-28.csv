1jm2qf1,UrbanPKMonkey,Broken 2k messages and 200 active people per day is certainly the right direction. I would love to see how we compare to other projects,7,1743188938.0,2025-03-28 19:08:58

1jm2qf1,phi_curious,I guess that is impossible to do?  I can only say from my own experience of watching the raw activity in other chats: we outperform projects that have a MC in the hundreds of millions.,7,1743189479.0,2025-03-28 19:17:59

1jm2qf1,phi_curious,"üôèüôè good point to add that and raise awareness. But to be fair, I‚Äôm pretty sure Ruben is an advanced AI. Dutch YTs are known for using AI to create content. So it‚Äôs probably intentional.",5,1743189405.0,2025-03-28 19:16:45

1jlwkaa,Lalph-Rauren,"I utilize my YouTube channel to make easy to follow guides on how to buy $KENDU.  Look into your own skillset to see how you can contribute üòé  70% of all our active TG comes out of Reddit, you could always make a Reddit post, share it in the TG and the community does the rest. That‚Äôs the power of the kendu community, it‚Äôs an autonomous group of individuals who all have the same goal in mind.  Or just mess around in the TG, it‚Äôs always fun to be in there.

1jlwkaa,Expert-Detective-525,"Theres a pinned section on the telegram that always has stuff to do it in. If you see a tweet or a reddit post, add a comment and like the post. Also like and reply to other comments on the post.  Also, if all of that is done, just hang around the tg and people will often send in tweets, if so just like and comment them.",15,1743178464.0,2025-03-28 16:14:24

1jlwkaa,TheGDC33,I would spend time learning about Kendu and discover why you are bullish on Kendu. If you know that it will make it easier to get your own personal network in on this movement. That is the idea we spread like a movement across the globe where people are leveraging their passions to further the brand!,14,1743178732.0,2025-03-28 16:18:52
1jlwkaa,UrbanPKMonkey,"I was in the same situation as you. I work in IT and had no clue how to help or bring real products to life. That was until someone said ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt it be amazing if we could get a summary of the TG as there‚Äôs too many messages‚Äù. Then that started my brain whirring and now you have the 24H Recaps!  You‚Äôll figure it out, there‚Äôs no rush. Just keep buying, holding, raiding the socials, and get your network of family and friends onboard.",9,1743182339.0,2025-03-28 17:18:59

1jlwkaa,skillmattic,"The ways are endless lol. Whatever your hobby is, incorporate it with KENDU and share it to the world. The community is creative and innovative. The more unique ways of sharing KENDU the better. I remember a chad came up with beer coasters with the logo and QR code on them. Every bar he visited he left the coasters. I created and printed 500 stickers with the logo, CA's, our motto, our socials, the name ""Kendu Inu"", join the pack phrase and a QR code. I like to travel, so I keep a stack of stickers with me wherever I go. Just have fun with it and enjoy the comradery at KENDU! Of course buying and holding forever is the best workü´°ü™ñ",5,1743215913.0,2025-03-29 02:38:33
