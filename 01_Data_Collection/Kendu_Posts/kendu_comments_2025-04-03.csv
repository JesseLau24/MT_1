1jqq00f,RegardedQt314,love the structure that we've established to this point.  very autonomous and self driven!  no one central figure which is exactly what we've preached all along.,15,1743705862.0,2025-04-03 18:44:22

1jqq00f,Hot-Raspberry2758,"Thanks for the amazing writeup Chad! It's helpful and encouraging to see how the community steps up with their own unique skillsets to build kendu into a multifaceted platform. Imagine if kendu would have launched to -10b a year ago. It would just be like another memecoin with no real community support to propel it further. The community is actively preparing the framework for not just another coin. It's THE COIN. We are building the next generation of crypto community platforms. We are integrating crypto into all faucets of life. Would our determination and drive be at the level it is now if we had just been given listing's from top exchanges? I'm not sure. It's because we got to work for kendu as a community, thats the reason we will propel into the billions and beyond. It's because of YOU  ‚ù§Ô∏è We Don't Gamble, We Work ‚ô•Ô∏è",15,1743716172.0,2025-04-03 21:36:12
1jqq00f,insegniah1,Awesome post and thanks for the inclusion fren :)  Those who are not named are equally important as those who are.  We all play a crucial role in developing kendu in to where we want to be and im so grateful to be sat here with everyone who works tirelessly to get us to where we need to be :)  And as ryoshi says: we can all contribute in ways we see fit!  https://preview.redd.it/ct3yl7m75tse1.jpeg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7ea6ed5d2c5b019201bc44bb4104f4acf1dc221f,14,1743767909.0,2025-04-04 11:58:29

1jqq00f,lorniko,"Honestly this is really not what is Kendu!  We do not promise anything. Our culture is ""nobody will come to save you/us, if you want to succeed, work for it.""  And that is exactly what is going on in our community. We don't want ppl who are complaining and not working. These guys we do not hesitate to ban them. We are not here to babysit ppl. Or you understand our ethos, like it, understand it, participate or simply believe in it. Or you just go somewhere else.  It's was the previous Dev who was selling dreams with all the ""SHib connection"" and ""secrets things that will come"".  This isn't our approach at all! I am a man of principle and honour, I was depressed because of this dev but didn't want to leave kendu because my friends that I made were in Kendu. Now we are happy to work hard and develop it.
