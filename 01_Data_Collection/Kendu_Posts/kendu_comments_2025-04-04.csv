1jrlz0k,TheGDC33,Yo this recap is something I am finally learning how best to utilize. For example that Lewk debate summary is something on my mind for sometime. I saw it is off the dailies and wondered and assumed some convo had been had. Great to be able to get a TLDR about things like that without asking in chat or searching.   Keep up the great work!🦊🪖,12,1743804202.0,2025-04-04 22:03:22

1jrlz0k,UrbanPKMonkey,"Thanks! There are so many times I’ve ran the script and been surprised by the results. You don’t realise how many chats you miss in a day, let alone realise what discussions really matter to the community.

1jrjj94,Wichty80,nah thx .. I don't want to talk in spaces 😆,12,1743793002.0,2025-04-04 18:56:42
1jrjj94,phi_curious,"Imho speaking on spaces is one of the best ways to make meaningful connections on X and to promote Kendu. It also puts you in a different mindset because you have to be more clear with your thoughts: what is kendu? What makes it so special? Why should you join the community?  Naturally not everybody feels comfortable with speaking publicly. But this is something everybody can learn and get comfortable with. Take it step by step. Talk in a VC in the TG or one of our unrecorded spaces. Next start in one of our recorded spaces, or the Kendu community space. Then branch out to some of the more relaxed and smaller spaces on X that are not Kendu related, e.g. Troll King Kendu (a proper Kendu chad) hosts regular spaces where you can talk about anything.   Right now is a perfect time to get started with this. The market has slowed down, spaces are less packed and busy. So this is perfect to learn before the craziness of the storm and to make lasting connections. And beyond helping Kendu, it also will help you as a person.  Maybe we can organize a space where we just talk about that. How to speak on spaces?",12,1743793184.0,2025-04-04 18:59:44
1jrjj94,Lalph-Rauren,"Lorniko, you are a CHAD for hosting these spaces!! They are so much fun. Also hats off for Axl supporting you as a co-host! 😎  I try to always be on there, sometimes it’s not possible because of my personal life.   But guys, GO AND CHECK IT OUT!! Great stuff being shared, you can ask anything, no pressure at all :)",10,1743793206.0,2025-04-04 19:00:06
1jrjj94,TheGDC33,"Facts, great article and great points. When things start kicking off again I plan to get back on the train and speak about Kendu to whomever will listen and have me",5,1743798959.0,2025-04-04 20:35:59
1jrjj94,UrbanPKMonkey,I’ll always dip in when I can.  I don’t mind speaking but sometimes I waffle and it becomes word salad without getting to the actual point. Either way it’s all good practice. Hopefully next time I’ll be there before the last 5 mins 😆,4,1743799618.0,2025-04-04 20:46:58

1jrjj94,lorniko,"I think Ishan is often available for that, if we tell him before, he should be available.  For the other question I think I know all the possible reasons. Lack of self confidence, some the English level, some they just don't like it and others aren't ready with their arguments and maybe don't feel legit. Also if the conversation turns too much crypto, some ppl are not so comfortable with their crypto knowledge.",7,1743794007.0,2025-04-04 19:13:27
