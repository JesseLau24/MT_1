1jwxdp9,phi_curious,"Hi L3nni8, thanks for the proactive post. I like that you open the conversation.   Also wanna give a shout out to u/CoopVelociraptor who brought this up in the TG and who will have good input.  Sorry for the unstructured post. These are just my random thoughts:  From my point of view we need to add more content that is not just a random ""smash this"" or ""smash that"", we need content that is funny, that opens a conversation, content that is different and thoughtful.  If we make content that is fun and engaging people naturally come back, because they want to hang out here, and that will also increase our ""smash"" effort.   I have been thinking on how I can contribute, maybe people can give some input on these:  1. post more memes [https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu\_Ecosystem/comments/1jw2rp7/happy\_thursday\_chads\_chadettes](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/comments/1jw2rp7/happy_thursday_chads_chadettes)  2. write articles that are thought provoking [https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu\_Ecosystem/comments/1jvy5zk/did\_you\_read\_the\_snack\_machine\_post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/comments/1jvy5zk/did_you_read_the_snack_machine_post)  3. make a GM post that sets the mood for the day, e.g. a fortune cookie wisdom of the day, or a window of the day. I like the 24h recaps because they are important to create a tight bond between community members, and I think that a similar format that is focused on how to move forward could be interesting. I am not sure yet though what that would exactly be.  In the end though, whatever kind of content each individual creates, it has to be fun to the creator. It should never feel like a task that you have to do, but rather something that you enjoy.",15,1744398399.0,2025-04-11 19:06:39
1jwxdp9,Imbetow,"24 recap   Kendu daily metrics  I'm on the telegram group but I prefer to use reddit because I cant stay in touch with my cell phone so I miss a lot of messages on telegram so I don't really know what people talking and I don't really like to read all the new 1,500 messages every time I open the telegram group haha",13,1744399164.0,2025-04-11 19:19:24

1jwxdp9,CoopVelociraptor,"Agreed! More actual content, and it‚Äôs cool that we‚Äôre thinking about it but tbh we could ez start with what we already blast on X.

1jwxdp9,phi_curious,"That is understandable, we only got that many hours in a day, so reading everything becomes challenging.  Let me ask you this. when you say you wanna stay in touch, do you mean you want to know what is going on in the community, e.g. what was talked about, maybe some personal stories that were shared, some bullish news.  Or do you mean you want to see links to posts on social media that you can add comments to?  Just trying to understand what people would like to see. Thank you.",8,1744399775.0,2025-04-11 19:29:35

1jwxdp9,phi_curious,"Yo Coop, what‚Äôs up? Thanks for the input.  That is a good idea, I guess we could make a pinned post where we post the raid targets, just need to be smart about how we do it otherwise old threads are getting raided lol  As for X content, can you elaborate more? I agree that some of our content on X suits well on here, eg the kojak articles, you video game teasers‚Ä¶what else though?

Someone said above about opening up the conversation inviting people in and the approach in my eyes feels like it could be very insular (not sure if that is the right word) where it isn't actually reaching people or getting people in. I see the same one token recently posting everywhere nonstop the same recycled content.   I don't know because I have rose colored glasses on and I just love Kendu but I wonder if people view us in the same way as I view that coin. Like they don't want to read it or do they end up reading it cause we are everywhere??? No idea.  Also market conditions do matter, so maybe these points mean nothing. We are stuck again in a range of holder up and down up and down (market PR baby the real challenge and we just need to keep going) I guess I think more purposeful to invite people in is my addition to this convo (yes very late I know, but here I am doing what I can when I can). Maybe targeting one influencer/big account where we have a clear opening and making sure everyone jumps on that thread so we get 200 across the board as the goal.

1jwxdp9,phi_curious,Thanks for sharing your thoughts. I think our perspectives align quite closely.  You are definitely correct that markets matter and currently not as many people are looking at crypto or investing as much time. On the other hand that also means that this is a good time to build some new strategies and content.  Let me think about how we can condense all of that info into Reddit content :)  Also I‚Äôm gonna send you a DM here with a question.,3,1744439729.0,2025-04-12 06:35:29
