1k23ejr,wintertime1967,Very awesome!! I was reading on kendu ecosystem on TG. I hope you are feeling better! Brings to mind when the Chad's were selling out and I wanted to buy one but was like 5bucks short on eth.  I mentioned that on TG not expecting anything from this casual comment and Yurri asked for my wallet address so he could cover it. And the man sent me 50 bucks!  I tried to pay back later but he didn't want it. Great community in kendu!!,4,1745084128.0,2025-04-19 17:35:28
