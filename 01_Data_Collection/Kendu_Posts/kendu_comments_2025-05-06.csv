1kfpuv3,Expert-Detective-525,"Hi dude, I understand the uncertainty, but in tough times like this, it is best to see the full picture. We are recently coming out a brutal, brutal market with ETH falling 50% this year alone, yet Kendu has stuck strong and has doubled since the CTO!!!  There is a bull run coming and Kendu is gonna bounce back and soar past ATH. I can say my opinion on how high we will go, but no one truly knows......   I bought in June and have never ever had a green day in Kendu, I have been in a loss for nearly 11 months and yet I remain as bullish as ever and keep buying more. Why?  Because I look around and see the strongest community in the space currently, we are dominating Reddit and Twitter. In terms of pure metrics, kendu is keeping up with some of the strongest coins in crypto(even those in the hundreds of millions), in real life we are setting an unprecedented standard!  Shib, Pepe all went through very tough and brutal periods, but this is so important to reduce sell pressure when we move past the big milestones(100 million, 1billion, 10 billion)  It has been proven time and time again that community only matters and that community determines the value of a memecoin, Kendu is no different  Are you in the tg?

I‚Äôm not gonna name any other coins but if you look at any of the ones that have been around for awhile everything is down 50-90%.  Kendu is and will always be my biggest conviction play.

1kfpuv3,___Revenant___,"Well we cant tell you what to do. But I guess its worth asking yourself if you have a different coin you actually believe in more to put the funds into instead. Because selling the bottom right now, on an actually active and building community.... Not sure if its the call Id make.   Granted, I was thinking of meme-coins. If you want the far safer bet of something like XRP or something, well hey that's valid too. You just miss out on the potential upside potential.   But if your staying in the memecoin sphere, I cant think of any alternative besides KENDU.   Stay strong my man, don't get shaken out.
