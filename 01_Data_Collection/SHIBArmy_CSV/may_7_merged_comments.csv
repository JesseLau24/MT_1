1i2d735,artdirror,"Guys, let’s break this down. We’re talking about an ERC-20 token with a $14 billion market cap. Swapping through the ETH network is expensive because of gas fees, and XRP is essentially a dinosaur coin with the 4th largest market cap. Unless you’re an insider or ridiculously wealthy, no one truly knows how price fluctuations will play out.    You can analyze charts all day, but if big money pulls out, that’s it—value disappears. A $50 investment in something with such a large market cap isn’t going to make anyone rich overnight. Understanding these dynamics might help bring some peace to folks in this sub who seem confused or frustrated.    At the end of the day, investments are all about leverage and timing, no matter the asset. I personally like SHIB, but sometimes we like things that might not be as popular anymore—it happens. Arguing over it doesn’t help anyone. If you’ve already invested, just hold on—you never know what might happen.    What do y’all think?",9,1737129041.0,2025-01-17 15:50:41
1i2d735,armhanson,"If there’s going to be any real movement, it’s going to be massive. But that’s not going to happen soon. It’s silly to sell now unless you’ve invested thousands, which is also silly. You don’t need to invest a lot to make a massive amount of money on these things. You just need patience. I took away 300,000% gains in ’21 with doge. That was after selling in ’19. I could have waited and sold for 30,000,000% gains. This coin will jump as well. People who say it won’t are a part of the joke that is the fuel for all meme coins. And that is the wisdom of the doge. You can take it for fact or scoff at it. The outcome remains the same.",4,1737104091.0,2025-01-17 08:54:51

1i0i9v8,Sad_Kaleidoscope3286,"I don't think crypto is following a straight logic tbh and I don't think you can tied it to real world inflation, that's kinda decorrelated. I would be more looking at what money flow could come massively and from where. 5 years from now, states will stop wondering whether they should have a BTC safety stock, they'll all have. Also co sider that the Blockchain has not at all taped into the real world yet. Once it has, that will increase the number of transaction and I crypto, usage brings price up. For me the main barrier is the market cap that has to be consistent with other major cryptos like BTC. Of BTC hits a million or so in 10 years, then it might be possible to hit 0.1 and more if SHIB is still around in a decade (which could be of we stick to what the team is developing.

Although I don't think it will hit 1$ either, but that's not the point I think. Although as for any alts the multiplier is also much stronger or can be at least so it can't really be compared to BTC on that point.  End of the day the good portfolio is made of a good mix, differentiated based on everyone's beliefs and risk taking ability. But definitely not a good thing to put all saving on risky bets.

1ihb238,Secret-Computer-7637,Still the point still stands that Shiba in 2020 nov 28 being sold during 2021 WILL BE MONUMENTAL than btc in a year of investment.  Point is THE TALK ABOUT BEING RICH not average INCREASE OF VALUATION.  Btc 1/1/2020 up to 1/1/2021 from 9k to 37k cad is only 400% increase for value only  not even close to shiba inu 0.000 000 000 010 301  going to  0.000 088 40 is like 6 decimal place gone. 10m% gain was it not really good with math with high numbers but more monumental IF ANYONE GOT THE FORECAST ability to do so.

From this post, I’ve gathered a “feature” is “burning” or forever digitally destroying a set amount of SHIB. I’m assuming there is a finite amount of this stuff.  So I’m assuming the theory is that over time, people will randomly burn SHIB until the supply continues to come down as price per SHIB increases.  I’m wondering what motivates a burn and what else I should know.  Basically, why the f*** are you guys rock hard for SHIB.",3,1738287609.0,2025-01-31 01:40:09
1idz6a7,NihilistHUGZ,Its a thing because it started as one of the original MEME tokens and from there it began building an ecosystem that has several mechanisms and other tokens attached which give the ecosystem greater functionality. When the token kept evolving and hitting all the Milestones put forth by the development team it caught my attention. The burns are not something that we do or any one person does it's built into some of the platforms that they've created so for a transaction that occurs on that platform and whatever token a fee is collected and converted to Shiba Inu and so on and so forth. No one has to go take their coins and go burn them or send them to any kind of dead wallet that's already being done for all of us so that's why I'm excited about it is because I don't have to give up any coins and scarcity will happen. Another one that I keep advocating for is for further utilization that finds a way to incorporate the ecosystems for Shiba Inu then it will drive greater burn rates. I've talked quite a bit about this and I wouldn't mind to do some theoretical math here. In the past I've gotten eat up on this conversation but over the past six or seven months I am pretty confident in what I'm talking about,4,1738299875.0,2025-01-31 05:04:35

1iwrq4v,NihilistHUGZ,"Oh so investment advice from someone who sold years ago. Do you think people care about your insights when you only came back after making a 3233.33% profit to drag the asset, because it hasn't repeatedly undergone those appreciative cycles for others to experience the same profit as you? Your experience is relative and not relavent due to the reality of the growth cycle for this asset. Anyone holding for a quick bag has lost focus on what a viable asset is.  The focus for many is that this asset in particular started as a MEME and has grown to real world use case and adaptations which utilize the ecosystem. This has transitioned from something you experienced to now something we are experiencing.  You can dislike SHIB but in this phase of asset class growth and evolution, sentiments and your sentiment are an issue which degrades the value of this asset that others are invested in relative to their own experience. If you want to see SHIB fail then it will be because people like yourself keep coming back to scare current investors. Hypothetically but also realistically this is becoming a long term value asset.  As long as partnerships and integrations such as the recent UAE Energy Department utilization of the SHIB ecosystem continue there is no reason to doubt the long term viability and success for others to hold SHIB in their portfolio. Not everyone holds JUST SHIB btw. Some like myself are utilization driven investors who are capturing the cryptocurrencies tied to emerging sector utilizations in what I perceive to be the greatest evolution of the global economic structure since the Industrial Revolution.",2,1740502584.0,2025-02-25 16:56:24

1iwttu7,NihilistHUGZ,"Over the past few months I have learned a vast amount of the structure for bots or algorithmic trading. They are set to identify buy and sell signals based on metrics which track several different values lile rules. A human requires years of experience to recognize these same patterns but even then there is no competition for the algorithm that identifies those same patterns to the 'value' meaning higher frequency of potential trades.  One of the greatest challenges is the frequency of these trades and keeping up with them. They also work against each other as well as many people use them. So if someone improperly sets the rules for the algorithm the consequences affects the other bots and humans in a terrible cycle.  These algorithms are set by large investors and other companies pay for these service to do everything from provide liquidity/suck liquidity, false flag dumps, market aggregates, and many other ways to benefit and harm the process movements of EVERY ASSET CLASS NOT JUST CRYPTO.

We could get more burns by finding companies to utilize the Shibarium. I have a petition for just that. The more SHIB gets utilized for payment systems the fees can be burned off if they utilize the Shibarium and that can generate massive burns to create accelerated scarcity and value.

If you look at what I said then it is hypothetical but I have provided my math on this in the past and my idea is plausible and realistic.  Any discussion of the burns on the effect they have for price movements are currently irrelevant bc you are partially right. The only impactful burn was Vitalik.

I don’t know what kind of revenue an end user watching an ad generates but say it’s .01 cent/ad watched. I would think it would be possible for shib to use that revenue purely for burns.   The thought process here is that an end user who owns shib could almost passively help burning without needing to purchase shib to do it themself.  Any “game” mechanics around the ads just waste more time.  Yes this would still be extremely minimal amounts of burns per day but I think it would help and allow users to feel like they can make a difference.

I guess being in crypto for many years now these cycles don't surprise me. I am however certain that this one's different &amp; matter how good at techs it's still completely unpredictable. Shib has made me a lot of money, it's low cost enough to mess with and if you don't need it just keep an eye on it. The difference in % where BTC is vs a lot of alts is not locked in correlation which makes you wonder if BTC backs down into the 70s where the hell are alta going?🤔 A lot are at lows so does that mean alt season begins or do they follow BTC and drop lower than pre cycle? I will say this is how I figured it would go hype fades coins die but doge lasts &amp; imo shib will last. It's too big and there's a lot at work. Get yourselves to a point in price where you have enough that you don't need it to moon for yourself to take big profits. We've already got bags of it. You know it's going to go up and down. If you don't, trust us. It will. Swap to stable on a pump, swap back in a drops and multiply holdings lowering your avg cost and one big pump later cha ching, again!

These cryptos will keep gaining value whether you like it or not, that’s just the way it is. Doge will do the same, before last bullrun it sat at .002 forever then boom, .74 cents. Crypto will be here for a very long time bud, you screaming calling people scammers isn’t going to stop anything. The next transfer of wealth from the older generation to the newer generation will be injected into the crypto market. That’s just the way it is. I’m not saying crypto is the only thing you should invest in, I believe real estate is the best investment out there. However, crypto being so volatile is a high risk/high reward play, when you watch the market cycles over the course of years you can time it so that you buy when it’s low and sell when it’s high. People trade every day in the stock market for profit whether it be buying long, short positions and options. Crypto is the same shit just more volatile. The only way crypto will go away is if Satoshi wakes up and cashes out his millions of BTC and completely destroys the price. That’s literally what it would take.

The huge holders are the ones who use algorithmic trading programs that harvest money for themselves but It keeps the price suppressed for the rest of us. Whales using algorithmic trading programs are losing their asses in Shib! The problem is there’s so much Shib and so little owned. 80% of Shiba Inu has never been bought.  It’s just sitting there unowned and there’s so much Shib still waiting it makes it difficult for the automated trading platforms to work. Plus the amount of whales that were manipulating Shib was disrupting others who used algorithmic trading programs. So if we see another zero drop we’ll see the whales coming back.

Everything in SCORCH is **on-chain, transparent, and fully auditable**—anyone can check the smart contracts and burn records. It’s not about trusting a third party, but **empowering the community to take action** instead of waiting for SHIB leadership to act.  If SHIB’s team officially adopts SCORCH, great.

1jcuxfm,NihilistHUGZ,But that's why I say it sounds scammy is due to the fact that the eip-1559 protocol built into the SHIB ecosystem already offers the ability for users to transparently see the accumulation of BONE which dictates when the burn can happen after BONE reaches a point of 100 being accumulated. Right now it's averaging out to a little over 12 million SHIB once that BONE is converted but anyone with a wallet that contains she but Inu can connect to the ecosystem and initiate a burn when they see it's over 100. Also there are groups in the ecosystem which you can Bridge your Shiba Inu tokens 2 and they will initiate Burns based upon Community input.  Scorch is trying to do something that already exists and that is like saying when I go to the bathroom Scorch will be there to wipe my booty for me. I can do that myself and the ecosystem Shiba Inu has which utilizes the EIP-1559 protocol gives me the ability manually as well as other bridged groups.   I just really want you to consider how it sounds. Scorch wants a person to sign up so that they can initiate a burn for you or provide a community for Shiba Inu to burn Shiba Inu when you can already do that yourself. It sounds to me like Scorch is a new token that is trying to capitalize on the existing successful community and gather users to think that it's going to generate more burns when in fact it will not generate any more than the ecosystem already allows and because of the way the development team created the burn mechanism so BUILT-IN Scorch is redundant so even if it is really it will fail because the utilization makes no long term sense and when investors realize the redundancy it will lose positive sentiment and fail within one year.,2,1742158899.0,2025-03-16 21:01:39
1jcuxfm,bigbadcoinwolf,"I see where you're coming from, but SCORCH isn't trying to replace SHIB’s EIP-1559 burn mechanism—it’s designed to enhance and expand it by making burns more frequent, decentralized, and incentivized. The fact that SHIB’s burn system exists doesn’t mean it can’t be improved or supported by additional tools.  SHIB's current burn model relies on network fees and manual execution, meaning burns happen at a fixed rate and only when conditions are met. SCORCH introduces a community-driven, gamified approach where burns aren’t just passive or occasional but active, continuous, and rewarding for participants.  You mentioned that SHIB holders can already burn manually—true, but how many actually do it? SCORCH removes friction and encourages participation by giving users real incentives through rewards, competitions, and staking mechanisms.  It’s not about “wiping for you” but about creating a system where burns happen organically at scale, without waiting for BONE accumulation, developer actions, or limited community-led events. SCORCH doesn’t force anyone to sign up—it simply provides another layer of burn efficiency and engagement that SHIB alone doesn’t currently leverage.  New ideas and tools don’t mean something is redundant—just like Uniswap didn’t replace centralized exchanges, SCORCH complements SHIB’s ecosystem and makes burning a more dynamic and engaging process. If SHIB already had fully automated, community-driven, incentivized burns, SCORCH wouldn’t need to exist. But it doesn’t—so there’s room for improvement.",1,1742159636.0,2025-03-16 21:13:56

1jcs0r6,Mr_Lightspeed98,"You do not understand how burns work.  Your calculation misunderstands how token burns actually influence crypto prices. Burning tokens by sending them to a dead wallet reduces the total possible supply, but price is driven by active market demand and the circulating supply actively available for trading—not simply the total number of coins existing.   Even if you burned trillions of inactive tokens, it wouldn’t automatically push Shiba Inu’s price to one penny unless demand significantly increased or tradable liquidity was sharply reduced. Your assumption that removing tokens directly and proportionally raises price reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of how crypto markets work.",17,1742152548.0,2025-03-16 19:15:48
1jcs0r6,freedom_fighting321,"If you write a burn contract directly removing the tokens from being counted as an on chain tally,  you definitely can change the price with very large burns.   Yes,  it would take a fuk ton of cash, or a very large mechanic via staking or something to accumulate and do large contract burns.    The contract burns is why the total on chain # isn't a nice round number.   Sending to a dead wallet doesn't effect the price as you would think it would immediately.      And yes,  you still need buyers and sellers to ultimately help the price jump on a burn.   Burning 100 trillion tokens at once via contract should in fact jump the price nearly instantly,  the price per token would reflect the immediate removal of circulated supply even if the market cap does not change.   BUT IT WOULD TAKE A SHIT TON OF TOKENS/MONEY IN 1 BURN TO SEE A PER TOKEN PRICE CHANGE.  🤷‍♂️",3,1742162970.0,2025-03-16 22:09:30
1jcs0r6,Mr_Lightspeed98,"You’re conflating the technical mechanism of supply reduction with its economic impact on price.  A “true burn”—which Shiba Inu does not have and cannot implement without redeploying its original smart contract—permanently deletes tokens from the blockchain, explicitly reducing the total supply directly on-chain. In contrast, sending tokens to a dead wallet doesn’t delete them explicitly; it simply locks them away permanently. Although this doesn’t technically change the total on-chain supply number, it effectively achieves the same economic result: these tokens are permanently removed from active circulation.  The primary advantage of a true burn is both technical and psychological—it transparently confirms supply reduction directly on-chain, which can boost investor confidence and market sentiment. However, economically speaking, both burning methods are functionally identical: tokens are permanently unavailable for trading regardless of how they’re removed.  **HERE IS THE IMPORTANT PART**  Here’s the critical nuance: neither burning method automatically impacts token price unless the action directly affects the liquidity pools or market demand. Crypto token prices on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap are determined exclusively by the tokens actively available within liquidity pools. Specifically, price is determined by the ratio of tokens to their paired asset (e.g., SHIB to ETH) in these pools.  Burning tokens that aren’t actively trading—tokens outside of liquidity pools—does not alter this ratio, and thus won’t immediately or automatically change the token’s price. While token burns can influence investor psychology and potentially drive long-term demand indirectly, the immediate market price calculation depends exclusively on active liquidity, not merely total on-chain supply.  Therefore, tokens held outside liquidity pools, whether burned via a true burn or sent to a dead wallet, are economically irrelevant to the immediate pricing mechanism.  To learn more, research the math behind automated market makers as they are the ground truth for pricing.",1,1742169536.0,2025-03-16 23:58:56

Think about this:   If SHIB has a market cap of $7.77 billion and 123330500 tokens are burned upon each 100 BONE it works out like this   12330500 / $7770000000 = 0.001586 tokens burned roughly per day per $ of market cap   Now lets factor that down with BTC by market caps   1.65 / 7.77 = 0.2122 proportionally  0.2122 * 1000 = 212.2 factor rate  212.2 * 12330500 = 2616532100 future tokens per burn initiated   Going even further in to hypothetical proportionality    212.2 factor * $0.00001322 (Current SHIB Price) = $0.00281 per token if the market cap of SHIB gets to the current $1.65 trillion market cap of BTC and that would only require industrial and governmental levels of utilization of the current ecosystem to generate burns over several years.   I didn’t factor in the scarcity factoring to the increase of price AND I also didn’t add in the intrinsic value the utilizations would be valued at adding even more to the potential price. That’s just business as usual and remember SENTIMENT IS KING….AND… I didn’t add that either. Objectively in the years ahead SHIB priced at $0.00281 a token is extremely realistic!",8,1742157443.0,2025-03-16 20:37:23

1jc4g10,Mr_Lightspeed98,"  I get where you’re coming from, but the math around burning tokens isn’t quite that simple. Here’s the thing:   • Burning tokens reduces supply, but price only rises if demand stays steady or increases.  • Your analogy of burning half the world’s money wouldn’t double everyone’s wealth; it’d create panic, economic instability, and loss of trust. To make everyone twice as rich, you take that half from half the people and give it to the other half.  • Token prices rely on many factors—demand, utility, trust, and overall market conditions not just scarcity alone.  So, burning tokens can sometimes help, but it definitely doesn’t always guarantee higher value.",3,1742072819.0,2025-03-15 21:06:59
1jc4g10,Brandine04,"The burn will work at its current rate in about 60 years. If a community decided to stop crying and actually did a proper burn then they could easily wipe off billions of coins per month but sadly to many people are greedy and not willing to understand loss, capital gains and write offs. The funny part is that if enough people participated, then everyone could sacrifice as little as $1 a week.  Sadly, it will never happen because of greed and a lack of understanding.",2,1742081388.0,2025-03-15 23:29:48
1jc4g10,NihilistHUGZ,"This in general is the way it needs to be understood. You cannot use the example of burning half the world's money because there is no expectancy for our money to be burned. There is however the expectancy of a burn mechanism built into the ecosystem to function properly. The best way to think about this is in fact about the math but to expand further and add in the hypothetical expansions and utilizations.  If you had several different countries with entire sectors of industry using Shiba Inu and the ecosystem it would in turn accelerate the burn rate. Scarcity does create value outright but also the burn mechanism acts as a deflationary mechanism as well for economies that could use it as a store of value to fight other traditional asset class inflation.  Large community projects can be generated and voted upon to remove tokens in other ways but essentially the ecosystem has already built it in for a long term way to create store of value.  Greater utilization of the current ecosystems and as those ecosystems improving, will enhance utilizations as well creating a cycle which will improve the burns and so on and so forth... Long term goals!   You have to stop thinking of the now and your preconceptions of what the burn mechanism is and begin understanding the built-in aspect for the ecosystem and what that actually entails. When you understand the ecosystem then you can begin to understand the hypothetics of utilizations. It's a great thing.",1,1742074312.0,2025-03-15 21:31:52

If say 150,000 of those members are active and buy/sell shib and each member was to burn 10,000 to 100,000 coins per 1 million coins purchased then you would see a dramatic burn rate in the 30 to 50 billion range. When the crypto community gets wind of that, they will buy or buy and help burn, which will cause more people to buy, and both the burn and FOMO effect will cause the price to rise.  The problem is getting people who don't mind a small loss for greater gains.

But they're working directly with the SHIB team. Whether they actually use SHIB as their reserve cryptocurrency remains to be seen, but no matter what, they're integrating Shibarium and the greater SHIB OS. So, regardless of what they end up using as their reserve cryptocurrency, it's going to have a huge effect on SHIB.  Think of it like this. Say the UAE doesn't buy any of the computers Microsoft builds/sells, but they run Windows on all their computers... Use Azure for their cloud services...etc. Microsoft is arguably making a much bigger killing that route, becoming a critical component of their infrastructure than by just selling a single product to the UAE. That's what the SHIB ecosystem is becoming. A deeply integrated, foundational core for much bigger, much longer-lived endeavors and advancements.",1,1741974784.0,2025-03-14 17:53:04

The collaboration is anticipated to bolster SHIB’s appeal and market presence.  ￼  Following the announcement, Shiba Inu’s burn rate surged by over 500%, with approximately 18.7 million SHIB tokens removed from circulation. Additionally, SHIB’s price increased by 8%, reaching around $0.0000164, and its market capitalization surpassed $9.5 billion, re-entering the top 20 cryptocurrencies.  ￼  This collaboration underscores the UAE’s commitment to embracing emerging technologies and setting a global benchmark for innovation in government services.  ￼",21,1739250931.0,2025-02-11 05:15:31

1ijezkl,Secret-Computer-7637,thats for day traders which u also NEED TO READ market Sentiment. If u can Forecast the trend u can do so. I sold my etc and bought it in some average medium price but Tank downwards as its not even reaching that median bought price  which was my mistake for buying in the graph where I thought the value won't go down anymore.  Simple explanation u should buy for the lowest you think it would get for shiba inu while sell it when it reach a quarter of penny. a penny is 0.01 while its quarter is 0.0025 shiba curren price to usd is 0.00001522. U sold it if You want to incur the loss lower than the MARKET VALUE of your price bought.  so if you even bought shiba inu in a valuation of .00001625 u already incurred loss. Those are only down If u plan to use that money for another investment of just don't believe in shiba inu anymore to reach another ALL TIME high OF lOSSING 2 DECIMAL PLACES.,1,1739140023.0,2025-02-09 22:27:03

They rip you a new one to get your crypto to your wallet. Gemini is not bad so far but you have to wait days to send your crypto to a wallet. Coinbase so far i have not a too bad experience.

1jsd6ws,Beautiful_Deer_2757,"Depends on the situation. If iv sold then it pumps sometimes, at the time its a situation where if i buy back in I could be top blasting. So if im not watching it and waiting for a dip, il just leave it but obviously in hindsight it seems stupid. This isn’t even my most painful reflection. Buying about 8,200,000 WIF for 3 SOL within the first few hours is the biggest one. I did constantly  it and sell on the way up, but after it passed 10 mill MC, again I felt like I could be top blasting. Oh how I was wrong. But back then I’d be in about 10-15 different plays in Sol, a few in ETH, as well as being active on several other chains to farm yields or airdrops. Now I’m still on several chains a day and finding new alphas to get in early on for good airdrop allocations, but not in the trenches so hard. Il jump into plays that iv watched for a couple of days so i know if its a quick rotate or a long hold to scale out of eventually.

I also just realized how price is correlated with WIF...wow  My rule is to make sure I take out initials always from now on at least and have a clear rule for long term or just for profit (I still believe in Kendu, so that is fine, but not taking a 15x on MEGA was so stupid of me).

1jqimt8,NihilistHUGZ,"Thank you for your podcast, and I enjoyed listening to your series with regards to direct democracy and blockchain utilization. In my personal life, I've kept involvement with the government in my direct life, and it has always been my opinion that there does need to be some form of modernization to the representative democratic process, if not a hybridization towards direct democracy. However, you touch on a fundamental main issue in your podcast with security, but outside of that, the fluidity of a liquid democracy seems to deviate from the idea of direct democracy.  With the complexity of the human component, the idea of implementing blockchain for direct democracy poses the threat of creating borders, like following the world war eras. The issue was that people were not static, like the borders were drawn, and it created internal issues following because it divided tribal lands and all sorts of things; we pose the same issue, but in a technological way, by making this democracy become a liquid state. The influence, where elected officials face constant threat of being removed based on their short term public dissatisfaction, will only result in a dynamic system that can only alleviate segments of a problem, while alienating the long term policy initiative.  This would undermine the stability of our institutions, as it would allow inherent inequality to stem from the levels of digital literacy and internet access, as you had touched on as well. In a way, the blockchain technology would further disenfranchise different vulnerable populations and discourage long term growth by creating a burden of short term volatility. In the same way that I find in my analysis that 'Sentiment is King', we can apply that same concept to the archetypal arrangements of human psychology, and if you take that and further refine it to a country like the United States and try to apply a liquid democracy, it would ultimately unbalance the power of the people and then further create a global instability. If all nations use a liquid democratic system, then how effective are the institutions for the localized individual, who becomes swept up in the wave of sentiment and forgotten, like the borders of the world war eras?",1,1743694629.0,2025-04-03 15:37:09
1jqimt8,Blotsy,"Thank you for listening. You have a lot of very poignant thoughts and points.   I believe your concerns to be valid. I argue that the problems you point out, can be solved within the confines of the same system.   Some things should be changeable, some things need to be adapted faster. Long term stability is very important for societal function. The democratic process could elect to set certain legislation in a firmer way. Requiring a super-majority of 70% of the vote to alter (or whatever number we, as a collective, deem appropriate).  A hybrid model would be more appropriate initially. We start a grassroot organization. We put the system in place. Then we gain enough voter traction to become a powerful voting block in our traditional elections. The politicians need to pay attention to what we are voting for. What we want. If they don't, we remove them from office in the next election cycle.   You speak very eloquently to the issue of managing a large country with this process. I think you're correct! This system would by it's nature, focus power to the local level. There may be some federal details that still require a national vote. Ideally people would feel empowered to make their local communities (country level) more powerful and easily accessible.   There's a big sentiment in the United States, that something has got to change. If we can rally people behind a system of governance (rather than political parties), I think we could find a lot of traction across the aisle.   Again, thank you for taking the time to listen and respond. I really appreciate it.",1,1743703818.0,2025-04-03 18:10:18
1jqimt8,NihilistHUGZ,"I really appreciate your perspective and have given this a lot of thought. I support using blockchain to reform our democracy, but I worry that the current proposal may end up creating a system that functions more like liquid democracy. In such a setup, votes can shift quickly, much like high frequency trading bots in investing that create rapid, unpredictable swings that most people cannot keep up with.  My concern extends to the idea that change can happen instantly. Our culture often expects immediate results, but important decisions need time to settle. Rome was not built in a day, and a voting system that reacts to every fleeting moment might only lead to short term fixes instead of thoughtful, lasting policies.  I am reminded of 'Fahrenheit 451' , where society becomes so absorbed in surface distractions that there is little room left for deep thinking. If our voting process mirrors this by reacting too quickly to shifting sentiments, we risk reducing our political system to constant reaction rather than steady progress.  I remain a strong believer in the benefits of blockchain and have long supported its use in various industries, as seen by my own petition for its broader adoption. I also know that SHIB is being integrated in the UAE. Reports indicate that the UAE is working with SHIB to bring Web3 solutions into their government services. Their Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure is partnering with Shiba Inu to improve operations and enhance public service, demonstrating that a measured approach to blockchain can yield real benefits in practice.  How might you suggest we create a governance framework that uses blockchain to keep things transparent and accountable while still allowing a pace that gives room for thoughtful reflection and long term stability?",1,1743712247.0,2025-04-03 20:30:47
1jqimt8,Blotsy,"This is such a wonderful question.   Complete transparency will be necessary for the system to function. Pair this with the need for complete anonymity, and you have a wonderfully complex problem.   Each person has one vote. This vote can be delegated to another. I can always see what my vote was used for. This keeps politicians honest. It is transparent to the constituents what their politicians voted for. The individual vote of a private person is just a token. The token can be anonymized through technology similar to ""cash tornado"" and the likes. I can always track my own token though. I have a record of who used my token, and for what.   With a modular voting system, anything can be baked into legislation.   Let's imagine a piece of legislation as a Reddit post.   ""Fix the potholes on Main St.""  The bill proposes that $X money be assigned to fix the potholes. That Contractor Inc. will be signed to fix it.  In the comments, people in the community believe it should be put up for a bid. The ""bidding"" comment achieves enough traction (and votes) to amend the original text. The potholes on Main St will be fixed, and any licensed contractor may bid on the job.   Once the bill has enough votes to pass, it will be locked for a week (or whatever amount of time is appropriate). This allows individuals who voted by proxy to retract their votes. It also prevents the politicians from switching their vote last minute, to change the outcome. The grace period is for proxy voters only.   To further speak to legislation that needs to ""settle"". If we pass a law that is for a long term benefit, it can have its rules baked into the text.   For example, this law can only be amended after four years, by majority vote. If a change achieves 69% of the majority, the four year rule can be overturned.   This question often goes hand in hand with executive power. What if we need someone to make an unpopular decision? It'll never be voted through the democratic process, but we must evacuate due to a hurricane warning. We don't have time to set the evacuation order to a vote. We need someone to make the call. Who makes this call?   I hand my vote to a famed and accurate meteorologist, this individual handles my vote in all hurricane emergency matters. They band together with their colleagues. Together they have the mandate to invoke an evacuation order. No need to heed a governor.   Here's where it becomes interesting. Mr. Business holds my vote on all matters of the economy. Mr. Meteorologist has my vote in a hurricane emergency. Business says that we can't shut down, the meteorologist says we have to evacuate. I get pinged to make a choice. My vote is about to be used in two different directions.   I have sent my vote off to work in my best interest, in an automated and transparent way. It asks me the question, what do I want?  Should the individual voter have such power? I would argue, yes. The individual person might not make the right choice, in a given situation. The democratic rule of the many, will average out to the correct answer.   This is a wonderful conversation. Thank you for engaging.",1,1743769831.0,2025-04-04 12:30:31
1jqimt8,NihilistHUGZ,"I really appreciate your creative approach to integrating blockchain into the democratic process. Your plan has many interesting ideas and it is clear you put considerable thought into issues such as transparency, anonymity, and expert intervention when needed. From my experience as an active participant in state government submissions and from firsthand insight through my father, who is a mayor, I worry that your system is missing a few important aspects.  I know how difficult it is to get genuine public participation. Even when channels exist for input, very few people engage, and even the ones who do often do not receive the attention they deserve. Moreover, working at the local level, I have seen just how challenging it is to balance budgets while reconciling the diverse needs of community members. I am not trying to shut down your idea at all. Instead, I think it needs a more fixed and managed framework.  I am thinking back to the legislative acts that were established after 9/11 and how they created our Real STAR ID. This existing system could be incorporated into a blockchain platform that uses government issued identification to address the digital divide. Registration could also be available at local government offices or community centers. This would enable someone who does not have access to personal devices or technology to sign up and take part in the process. The system would use our Real STAR ID to issue a unique digital token that represents our individual vote. Blockchain methods would secure that token so that it remains anonymous while still being fully verifiable. This would provide a layer of security and inclusion that keeps the system open to public audit.  Next, citizens would have to give their vote either directly or delegate it to someone they trust on a particular issue. The delegation option helps those who are busy or less confident in their expertise to assign their vote to a local expert or a trusted politician for that specific subject. Voters would be able to track how their token is used and could retract that delegation during a set window as you discussed. This feature would keep representatives accountable while ensuring that individual voters retain ultimate control over their vote.  With this in mind, I propose a multi stage voting system that includes a preliminary vote stage, as you suggested, with defined thresholds. For minor decisions, there could be a window of 48 hours to one week for reflection. For larger issues that could have a long term impact on policy, these would require a supermajority level of 70 percent before being enforced to protect against impulsive changes.  I already use systems that exist to participate in Senate level discussions and believe these should be incorporated into blockchain utilization. Every piece of legislation would be treated like a living document, with proposals publicly visible and recorded on the blockchain. Amendments could then be introduced and community members could comment on changes, offering a window for thorough deliberation and consensus.  You also touch on an important point regarding delegation in crisis situations. For example, in natural disaster scenarios, votes could be pre pooled, which would allow for swift action. Once the emergency passes, a post event review could occur using the living documentation method. The broader population could then reexamine and adjust those decisions, further balancing rapid responses without compromising accountability in the long run.  Given my experience with state submissions and the challenges I have observed in local government, I would suggest piloting any system on a small scale, such as in local municipalities. These would serve as test beds where the blockchain based system works in tandem with traditional public input channels. Real world participation in local government would ease the transition and provide us with valuable feedback.  This approach also serves as a major component to educate citizens on how to use a digital token based on their Real STAR ID while still allowing traditional voting methods. Clear communication about how each stage of the system functions and the timing involved would help citizens understand that they can be more involved without being overwhelmed. Continuous feedback and regular reviews would adapt the system to become more user friendly, secure, and effective.  I believe that by keeping the core of your idea and addressing some of the issues I have observed firsthand, we have formed the basis for a proper framework. I am really excited for your input and to see how we might be able to blend our ideas further.",1,1743779843.0,2025-04-04 15:17:23
1jqimt8,Blotsy,"I think we are mostly in agreement! We are having the same thoughts. You put it very eloquently.   Two issues I address in my podcast. First, engagement. People feel disenfranchised. Most Americans I encounter feel like their vote doesn't matter. The system still solves this problem, by it's inherent nature.  Second, there are requirements for the system to exist. The final stages of a direct democracy require that each citizen has Internet access and a device.   I consider Internet access, a human right.   The FFC already laid the groundwork with the abolishment of net neutrality. Access can now be provided by the service being accessed. Google should pay for my access to their search engine. The people are their product after all.   The government should pay for access to democracy.  The initial stages are going to be far more grassroots oriented, as you say.   It's been an absolute pleasure speaking with you. Yes, this is an idea that has sat with me since the inception of the blockchain.",1,1743827292.0,2025-04-05 04:28:12
1jqimt8,NihilistHUGZ,"This has been a pleasurable conversation, and given the history of this subreddit please trust that I have valued your iron sharpening mine. It is rare but welcome. I have a general principle that I follow using ""5 whys"" to get to the root of the problem, and your comment is the fifth since the podcast. If we follow this same principle, then we have seemingly come to the root of the issue. The root of the issue is value, the value of opinion, the intrinsic value of service, the value of democracy, the value of rights. It is at the root, value, that purpose meets substance. Without the value of privacy, would the FCC have abolished net neutrality? I do not see the value of that abolition without the value of substance and so on for a world lacking that substance. Intrinsically, value is the substance.  What in your life is free other than the air you breathe? No work can add to or truly take away from the true substance of that which fills our lungs, just as water or food is essential substance. Yet these require work, which can add to or take away from the substance, thereby creating value. The system of value needs to change before the substance can change. Although we have the infrastructure to achieve the substance, the work makes value a hurdle.  If we take any system, specifically direct democracy using blockchain technology, there would need to be individuals who invest time and effort to make that system function and exist. They then create value. We must address that. We cannot start there. What comes next is to look at the right of access itself before implementation. We must legislate and participate within an existing system to achieve that end, and again we create value through effort. Every aspect that we trace down is tied to a value component, and there is no overcoming that.  To begin, there need to be smaller systems that can grow into a larger network. In towns and at the county level the initiative should start with creating a right to internet as a basic infrastructure feature, like plumbing or electricity, and not merely as a secondary service. That would have to be established over a span of time to allow for redundancies and erosions as part of a test for a larger network of connectivity. Then at the state level those systems could further consolidate communications, resource allocation, and emergency management, for example.  An infrastructure needs to grow from within the system of value before the substance can overcome the value component. There is no avoiding that; it is a fact dictated by thousands of years of human development, not by me. Start with access and provision at the most local level, and everything from there will be achievable. At the smallest levels the greatest change is feasible. The implementation of blockchain in democracy in an expedited form would look like jumping off a cliff and barely being able to see the safety net. It is the sense of safety, the value of safety, and realistically it is just the human condition.  I again concede in the pleasure of this conversation and only hope that I have been able to add a touch of insight to help sharpen you as well.",1,1743868252.0,2025-04-05 15:50:52
1jqimt8,Blotsy,"I think a few of your points in your last comment were lost on me. In regards to substance and value.   I do think that the problem is a chicken and egg situation. These systems need to proliferate from the other. A change to our Fiat financial system needs to come from governance. To change our system of government, we need to make large changes to our financial system (value system?).   The options are: Enact small changes on a local level, or brute force either system (jumping off a cliff).   I believe a brute force alternative might be the correct answer here. When I say brute force, I do NOT mean violence.   Brute force means large societal pressure. This pressure exists already, it is a large generalized pressure without any specific direction. To speak in metaphor, the pressure of the ocean is large and evenly distributed across the ocean floor. This is the generalized dissent. If we gave the pressure an outlet. A directed pipe, draining from the ocean floor. That pressure can be directed and given motion. The pipe is the system of a direct democracy. The direction the pipe is pointing, is dictated by democratic means. We just need to access to the pressure. Give the people a means to exert their influence/pressure.

1jqimt8,NihilistHUGZ,"This line of conversation led me to studies and searching for how to connect with you in a way that would benefit your endeavor. It was, in a way, laid on my heart. Our conversation about heterodox economics sparked a renewed interest for me, and the concept of ""value"" is where I really dug in. I think there is a way to move forward, but your organization needs to enter the sphere of conversation with specialists such as Trevor Jackson or David McNally. The structures you discuss are anti-Marxist in nature, and I heard a quote that may resonate with you: ""Capitalism is not broken and in need of being fixed. On the contrary, it is working correctly, and in need of being overthrown.""  In all honesty, I want to say that the scope of the project you are proposing lacks ""six sigma"" for me, and I believe it needs greater structure. I mean no disrespect, rather, I fully support you. It is out of this support that I implore you to read 'The Fall and Rise of American Capitalism' by Stephen Maher and Scott Aquanno. This book provides foundational insights into what I refer to as ""substance"" and ""value,"" addressing the very core of capitalism and its historical creation.  I took my time to respond because I wanted it to carry the utmost value for such an engaging and meaningful conversation. Once again, thank you for this conversation.",1,1744477206.0,2025-04-12 17:00:06
1jqimt8,Blotsy,"Communism is an ideal set for a distant future. Capitalism is for the present moment, without regard for the future.   Communism has failed repeatedly, due to the technology not being there. I mean, for an equal distribution of wealth to function, we need an unbiased system. This system must not be influenced by human hands. So far, we have been unable to implement it. This is changing.  Capitalism as a concept is stunning and powerful. A free market, determining the value of goods and services. We place a value on these goods and services. This value is measured in money.   We have moved away from capitalism. We are in a post-capitalist world. Money can now be bought. The value indicator is now purchasable. This is fundamentally flawed.   We need a value system. We need to be able to determine that the service of a surgeon is of a higher value than the service of a man digging a hole.   These values need to be able to fluctuate in response to the needs of society. If a great flood is looming, the hole-digging service is suddenly in very high demand. Digging ditches and barricades. Maybe the value becomes so high, that the surgeon is encouraged to go digging with the rest of society.   We need a measure of value. This measure is just that, a measuring device. It should never be purchasable goods.  We need to shrug off a lot of the old concepts of capitalism and communism. These ideas were forged in an old society. We should still learn from history. We need to found our new philosophy on the shoulders of history. Redefining these ideas for a modern time is necessary. Being clear in our definitions is the key to creating a shared vocabulary to discuss our next steps.  Thanks for continuing to engage.",1,1744478191.0,2025-04-12 17:16:31

The current burn mechanisms don’t seem to be burning enough, but we’ll see if any surprises happen.   TLDR; unlikely to hit a cent in the next 5 years, or even 15 in my opinion.

1hvyrbf,The_GOAT_Collector,"Shiba Inu’s Future Value Requires Aggressive Burns or Bone Integration.  If Shiba Inu is ever to achieve exponential value, it requires a massive and consistent burn strategy—period. Burning trillions of tokens annually is the only way to reduce the overwhelming supply that holds back its price potential. Without it, the dream of significant value appreciation remains just that—a dream.  Another viable approach could be integrating Bone into the ecosystem more strategically, creating synergies that enhance utility and encourage burns indirectly.  But let's be clear: if Shiba Inu hasn’t burned at least 200 trillion tokens over the next decade, it will be a colossal failure. The supply is simply too massive to sustain any realistic price growth without drastic measures.  It’s time for the community and developers to recognize that without an aggressive burn mechanism or innovative solutions like Bone, we risk losing the momentum that makes this project exciting.

It's unheard of. People need to wake up and take the opportunity for what it is. Have a long term holding and short term to make some easy money to re-invest.

1ht3rmy,Viktory_Sport,"**The point of SHIB lies in its multifaceted approach to blockchain technology and community-driven initiatives:**  1. **Decentralized Finance (DeFi):** SHIB aims to be more than just a meme coin by integrating into the DeFi ecosystem, offering staking, liquidity provision, and other financial tools through platforms like ShibaSwap. 2. **Community Power:** The SHIBArmy exemplifies grassroots support, driving innovation and adoption through collective effort and enthusiasm. 3. **Ecosystem Development:** SHIB is part of a broader ecosystem that includes tokens like LEASH and BONE, with applications spanning gaming, NFTs, and metaverse projects (e.g., Shibarium). 4. **Charity and Utility:** The project has contributed to charitable causes and emphasizes real-world use cases like payments and rewards.  While initially perceived as a meme coin, SHIB is evolving into a more utility-focused project with a strong community at its core.",45,1735957069.0,2025-01-04 02:17:49

1ht3rmy,Viktory_Sport,"You're welcome! 😊  SHIB primarily operates on the **Ethereum base layer**, but it’s evolving to leverage Layer 2 solutions to improve scalability, transaction speed, and reduce gas fees. The SHIB ecosystem has introduced **Shibarium**, its native Layer 2 blockchain, which is designed to address these limitations.  Here’s what to know about SHIB’s Layer 2 support and interoperability:  1. **Shibarium (Layer 2):**    * Shibarium is built to scale SHIB and its ecosystem by offering a high-speed, low-cost network for transactions.    * It's focused on powering applications like ShibaSwap, gaming (e.g., Shiba Inu Metaverse), and DeFi projects. 2. **Interoperability:**    * While Shibarium is the primary Layer 2 focus, the SHIB ecosystem has shown adaptability. For instance, SHIB tokens can be bridged to other Layer 2s like **Polygon (MATIC)** or **Arbitrum** through third-party solutions or partnerships.    * Additionally, **Binance Smart Chain (BSC)** has supported SHIB for token transfers via bridges, offering a multi-chain presence. 3. **Community-Driven Expansions:**    * SHIB’s future could involve broader Layer 2 compatibility or integration into more blockchains depending on community and developer interest.  The move to Layer 2 (e.g., Shibarium) is a strategic step to ensure SHIB remains relevant, efficient, and widely usable as blockchain technology evolves.",9,1735957930.0,2025-01-04 02:32:10

1k2egfo,nycstockup,What is good entry price that has support I wanna buy,1,1745084445.0,2025-04-19 17:40:45
1k2egfo,NihilistHUGZ,Right now we have long-term and short-term neutral major pivot Points converging meaning that the support and resistance walls are well defined showing a bottom. If you're looking for a good buy in then I would take whatever your current Target entry price is and then look at the average true range for a long-term time frame which sets price movements at a typical current level of $0.00000096. So if we take today's average neutral level based on my algorithm we get $0.00001204. So a move below that that would be to $0.00001108 for lowest possible entry target and a move above would be $0.00001300. When I do my day trading I use ATR movements for quick insight and that would mean using my method your entry range to choose a buy postion rests within $0.00001108 to $0.00001300. Of you buy nearer to the top then you bought the short term top of the long term bottom. If you buy nearer to $0.00001108 then you are buying the short term bottom of the long term bottom. I can explain this out however you need so if this is a little confusing just let me know,1,1745095433.0,2025-04-19 20:43:53
1k2egfo,NihilistHUGZ,Also part of my trading strategy that I have put together over a few years is to incorporate into your entry strategy a straddle. Take whatever Capital you intend to invest and only inject 50% at any point within that range I gave you. Then follow it and DCA 30% when you see a strong dip and the remaining 20% keep DCA through every dip you see on down days until you're able to inject 100% of the capital into that investment. This will allow you to play a longer entry strategy and capture lower averages rather than taking the entire lump and throwing it in.,1,1745095639.0,2025-04-19 20:47:19

I have to wait for the downturn to buy and the wait to sell at 3 percent. The fact that people panic and sell thier stuff so fast made me realize I can make a quick buck.

1j3wdd7,CryptoMoneyLand,"You don't know the history of bone it seems.  The reason why bone was $15  was that when it was first minted, the supply was low. Supply and Demand.  The supply of bone was slowly increased from 0 to 250 M and then capped at 250M.  Then, when it was only like around 100 to 500 bones out there, the price was like $15.

1j2uo5g,Victorvnv,"Not really, it’s all air and nothing else .   First off putting 5-10 coins most of them centralized means there won’t be any clear direction outside random buying of coins and putting them in a wallet   Second of all most of these coins are centralized. That means that the companies behind them already have huge reserves and will likely low ball the retailers by offering huge OTC deals with discounts to the government meaning the prices are unlikely to really change and any upside will be eaten by the big bag holders selling directly to the government   As always the retailers and tax payers will be the liquidity for the already rich ones as they are the ones who hear the news the latest and are the slowest to react   Nothing good will come out of this meantime what Trump is doing with the tariffs will have immediate negative impact on everyone affected thus the market outside speculation is very bearish right now",7,1741040031.0,2025-03-03 22:13:51
1j2uo5g,GpPpbOaM,"You’re spot on about the companies using their reserves to position themselves. For better or worse, I think it was inevitable. Similar to the successful mom &amp; pop getting absorbed by a conglomerate, this blockchain tech was too good to go ignored. Now, we’re entering a sort of hybrid decentralization.   As much as I love the ideals of DeFi, supposedly ~94% of the population has never held crypto. No matter how much we shout, the retail adoption is relatively low. Meanwhile, Ripple Labs has been using those reserves to successfully position their blockchain to become the standard for global finance and Hedera’s partnered with the biggest public and private companies to establish their HashGraph as the highest standard for security now and against quantum.

One of the reason people stay is they are at lost from ATH.  Some wait for the 1$ that will never happen while some believe holding 1 millions will make them millionnaire wen they don't understand the liquidity attach to it.  Wen you look at it with cold mind you understand that it was delusionnal to become rich.  If you invest don't look at the price it mean nothing. Instead look at the % gain your money get and if you will be happy with it sell it wen you reach your target.    More higher mc are, the more money you need to invest to grab more. It not the usual working class that will profit most but the whale.  I went to crypto with some hope and after 5 years i realise the illusion million of people been throught.    Keeping a strategy is important and the one i use is DCA.  At the end for the no trader that what could pay off. With less risk.

Even if they did, again, only a significant price climb will attract new investors.   You guys need to stop creating empty hope. Either the devs/community create avenues that can burn the tokens, or we just sit for years to come with no real progress. That's the hard truth.   Were all tired of throwing our money into a pot just to have it taken by others and see no profit in our end.   If i feel this way, im quite sure other do to.   I haven't sold my shares, but I'm definitely not investing more because I've been holding for years with no real gains.   Shib lost their chance to have a bigger community when they took their time to develop anything, and when they did, they released a half made game that has yet to see any real updates. Or was it the exchange that was going to break the internet but took a year to get it to even work properly after it was already released?..",11,1737082902.0,2025-01-17 03:01:42

1ka2cum,NihilistHUGZ,Articles like this are becoming more common as institutional levels of awareness are recognizing Shiba Inu based on its growing utilizations outside of just being a meme where it's Origins began. Shiba Inu has an entire ecosystem that is functioning and is being utilized at many different industrial and institutional levels. I don't know if you all are paying attention but Shiba Inu keeps achieving while you're being blind to the success right before your eyes. There is a pathway for one penny there is a pathway for $1 and all of this is through utilization and you are seeing the beginning steps of a shift in narrative. It's not impossible and unlikely if within a 6-month time frame it was impossible and now everyone's magically aware that it can happen at the institutional levels. The problem is that news pushed a fud/fomo narrative for too long and now retail investors can't get that out of their head. A lot of times these arguments and the points that people are going to make against it are on repeat because they oversimplify something that they don't understand and are too afraid to just say I don't know. You all don't know how much Shiba Inu is going to be worth in any time frame so the fact that you're trying to argue that it'll never reach a dollar is kind of nonsensical. I can at least tell you daily roughly what the price is going to be and how it's going to move and I'm telling you that it will hit some amazing price Targets in the future whether that soon or far off I don't even know but I can tell you that there is a path established right now and it is usable to get there. If you don't believe in Shiba Inu sell your damn tokens and STFU because I would love to DCA some more and have just a little bit lower price and a bunch more tokens.,4,1745870021.0,2025-04-28 19:53:41

That title uses in a satirical way very real articles that use TA and other supporting fact-based data points to show that 1 cent and 1 dollar are GOING TO HAPPEN. The ecosystem will make it happen. I have read all of those articles so when ‘ME’ not anyone else says that institutions are changing the narrative for like the past month or 2 because the way they were capitalizing on the FUD/FOMO started to make them destroy the industry and erode investor confidences.    That all changed when people started capitulating from the market and they lost readers. To build up the base they stopped the emotionally charged SHILL and started alleviating that and your arguments are from the ‘OLD GUARD’ news articles pre-shift in narrative.    Bet you didn’t know that huh?! But I do and I did when I made my comment.    You didn’t do YOUR diligence with me.    This is not a simple asset anymore, but this subreddit still is.

1ka2cum,NihilistHUGZ,"Now its to be clear... I dont think you REALLY know what is possible with SHIB because believe it or not the roadmap for 1 cent is the same road map the leads to $1. If 1 cent is possible then so is $1. In time, there is a threshold where utilizations and burns start to have a compounding effect on price appreciation. Once the entire ecosystem has found its prime utilization it will fuel a scarcity boom that is built in to the system. All an investor has to do is HOLD and when the institutions start pushing SHIB closer to that threshold it will be similar to a Bitcoin Halving. This is basically the 1920s as far as relation to advancement levels in comparison to modern age economic structures. Evolution takes more time than a retail investor can bare but remember every big money asset that you always hear I wish I would bought that back in the 90s or years back.... That is literally SHIB and all of its accompanying ecosystem tokens RIGHT NOW and you are missing the moment while you ride the 'it isn't possible wagon' and its not even your original idea.

1ka2cum,NihilistHUGZ,"I take no offense but rather a pure wide eyed disbelief due to the way you characterized the outlook potential to a ‘never’. You’re now assuming that I don’t understand the way these technicals make up the asset. This only further details how narrow minded you are by saying that it is just a straight forward ‘it has to be burned’ mentality. The ecosystem has functionality to burn the SHIB tokens *read this part closely* AUTOMATICALLY BASED ON THE UTILIZATION OF THE ECOSYSTEM.   You fail to see ‘THAT’ point. The tokens that are apart of the SHIB ecosystem are being utilized by government level institutions and by corporations for transactions. These are just the early days too. Once the full breadth of the project is being utilized it will burn the tokens from the fees and I have broken down the hypothetical math on that and now THRICE I will copy and paste my own great point that makes this a reality with PURE DYOR MATH   “I posted this one a while back but the logic is the same concept and I dont want to redo this math so here it is 'copy/paste'   ""I got one for you! I know you've all heard the, ""What if Shiba Inu was the price of Bitcoin""... no one ever factored in the burns did they?? If you take as a hypothetical future base valuation for SHIB and the ecosystem the current valuation of BTC the burns could be extremely impactful to cost and scarcity. Think about this:    If SHIB has a market cap of $7.77 billion and 123330500 tokens are burned upon each 100 BONE it works out like this    12330500 / $7770000000 = 0.001586 tokens burned roughly per day per $ of market cap    Now lets factor that down with BTC by market caps    1.65 / 7.77 = 0.2122 proportionally   0.2122 * 1000 = 212.2 factor rate   212.2 * 12330500 = 2616532100 future tokens per burn initiated    Going even further in to hypothetical proportionality     212.2 factor * $0.00001322 (Current SHIB Price) = $0.00281 per token if the market cap of SHIB gets to the current $1.65 trillion market cap of BTC and that would only require industrial and governmental levels of utilization of the current ecosystem to generate burns over several years.    I didn’t factor in the scarcity factoring to the increase of price AND I also didn’t add in the intrinsic value the utilizations would be valued at adding even more to the potential price. That’s just business as usual and remember SENTIMENT IS KING….AND… I didn’t add that either. Objectively in the years ahead SHIB priced at $0.00281 a token is extremely realistic!""    This shows that as the market cap increases while coupled with burns from ecosystem utilization the whole thing is more than achievable. Not if but when will it happen is the better question to ask.”     And stop oversimplifying an asset you VERY obviously dont grasp the evolution, funtionality, or utility potential of. I dont expect a quick profit anymore because its not a highly volatile asset like when you sold. SHIB is stabilizing itself to be a solid store of value asset.    I will finish my trading guide and there will be a physical representation of my principles, fundamentals and more concepts about being an investor than you think I know to support my case in this discussion. I dont care your profits or what you do but your words are like a childs crayon drawing to me and I am genuinely shocked you put it out for someone like me to find! ",1,1745884706.0,2025-04-28 23:58:26

Smart Money whales have SHIB as a part of their managed portfolio and the reason that we see such stability is because serious analysts and skilled traders hold more SHIB than easily spooked looking for fast money retail investors.  Thats why as the price appreciation moves through the sell wall retail investors jump because they have been scared waiting to get out and break even.  Smart Money has nearly shaken out all the weak longs from small holders by letting their DCAs act as exit liquidity.

1ivjvsq,NihilistHUGZ,If you are down and you want to cut your losses then take the same amount you have or 1.5x the intial investment and find the lowest point of a dip during an upcycle and average down to reduce the overall loss.   Essentially you pay to not lose so much. Just wait for price to rise up over the 2nd investment and the gains will help stabilize your losses and then you can exit.   Its a trick i use on my losers bc I'm not perfect and I get into some situations but have learned how to turn a 20+% loss into a 4% loss or even flip to break even and sometimes end up with a smidgen of profit.   Just dont let losses cause you to capitulate to the point where you are purely emotional entering and exiting trades. Hone in on some TA and follow the charts until you can plot the entry and exit.  When you feel complacent or are looking at the asset with denial then it is time to take a step back and reasses your position.,1,1740258732.0,2025-02-22 21:12:12

Here are some companies that accept SHIB:  1. **Newegg** – An online electronics retailer. 2. **Overstock** – A popular online furniture and home goods store. 3. **AMC Theaters** – A major movie theater chain in the U.S. has announced that it will accept SHIB for ticket and concession purchases. 4. **Travala** – A travel booking site that accepts SHIB for hotel bookings, flights, and more. 5. **BitPay** – A payment processor that facilitates SHIB payments for various merchants. 6. **Twitch** – The popular streaming platform accepts SHIB as a payment method via partnerships with BitPay.  There are also smaller businesses and online merchants that accept SHIB, but it’s still growing in terms of widespread adoption. You can also use SHIB for purchases indirectly through payment processors like BitPay or Shopify merchants that enable cryptocurrency payments.",5,1740068044.0,2025-02-20 16:14:04

I do the analysis in voice to text and then go through and capitalize key terms. This repetition was my way of giving people a passenger seat as I drive through Indicators to teach how they are used.  TA is but 1 key aspect and a strong refined process can enable each of you to understand and make full sense of what you are seeing. This TA process is the FUD/FOMO killer. It was made specifically to track crypto and has been intimately refined for SHIB.  Looking ahead, I have plans to go through and do a refining process and may look for inputs to some of the planned improvements so be on the lookout.

1iavpy2,AsgarGER,"Is Shiba Inu (SHIB) Worth It?  1. Basics  Meme coin, launched as a Dogecoin alternative. ERC-20 token on Ethereum, no own blockchain. Mainly speculation-driven, minimal real-world use.   2. Performance &amp; Volatility  Highly volatile, price depends on hype (e.g., Elon Musk, social media). Large market cap but lacks real utility. Burn mechanism introduced, impact uncertain.   3. Future Outlook  Shibarium (Layer-2) aims for faster, cheaper transactions. NFTs &amp; ShibaSwap exist but no major DeFi breakthrough. Competes with Dogecoin, no clear market leadership.   Conclusion  SHIB is more speculation than investment, relying on hype rather than fundamentals. High risk, potential short-term gains, but no long-term value.",2,1738096139.0,2025-01-28 20:28:59

1iavpy2,boursesexy,You look informed . Anything good coming ? Or yourself you think its became a dead project ? Im wondering if there is still some kind of development around shib etc ? What is your take ? Been in for a long time but never felt people were that bearish before .,1,1737952959.0,2025-01-27 04:42:39
1iavpy2,Odd_Action_7418,"I don’t want to say I’m bearish, cause I still have faith in the community, but my hype for it being bullish has faded. I’d say I’m neutral at this point. I don’t want to type too long and write an essay. But some things that truly bothered me, was shibarium, there was much hype and anticipation around it, it was gonna bring Shiba Inu coin to kill a zero. Shibarium, well for me it isn’t, but some people find it very difficult to use (as well as shib.io), same as with some other projects the team has made. Now I know not everything will be perfect off that bat, things take time, but it seems like the last few years they’ve completely forgotten about shibarium, bone, treat, leash. The idea, if I’m not mistaken, was to be able to list coins onto shibarium, to have projects on it, with as well as the major player to it, Shiba Inu coin being the gas fee for the transactions which would result in those coins used as gas fees going to a burn. Another idea before shibarium came around, was the idea to introduce Shiba Inu coin as an alternative gas fee for eth with vitalek, but I have no idea what happened with that and why that’s not even talked about anymore(it was one of main things that made me go, hey this a great idea, I’m willing to invest into this). There has been a huge lack of burning, the most burns we saw are from us, the community/shibarmy and shibtoshi, and when people on X got excited and thank shibtoshi(@shibtoshi on x), shytoshi got really upset about it, post have now been deleted, but he was doing subliminal hate posts towards shibtoshi and some team members who were praising him. I feel I’m going on too much, but anyways, promoting a bunch of coins on solana is not good look for shibarium. Specially when those coins he promotes, usually gets rugged, and he deletes all the posts promoting them. He promoted the hawk tuah scam, and lot more before it. He promises a lot, but nothing has really happen, other than a few app games (that are suppose to burn shib but I don’t think they are), he left a bunch of bone, leash, treat holders in the dark.. lot of the original team have been vocal about him on x. I say check them out, see what you think about it, (@shibtoshi is an og huge huge bag owner of shib) but check these og team members and their posts @imrjcyka and @ShibaTrophias , few other pages would be @Shibaholder_  @Labib_co And the official Shiba Inu coin burn @shibburn has called shy out about certain and gave warning to the community as well. @cryptolollla was another account but her account got deactivated and some speculate someone did a bunch of false reporting to get her banned. (Idk if it’s true or not) it’s a lot of drama. I know I’m missing a few things but those were my main reasons. I’m not anti Shiba Inu coin, I still have my bag that I’ve been holding for years, but I do not like the direction shy has been taking us, if he has even been leading shib to any direction. I still have faith in shibarium, I still have faith in bone, leash, treat etc(which I do not own), I have faith in the community, because we’re a great community! My advice is, take what you read from this and ask other community members as well! Specially on X! There’s a great bunch there, I believe in doing your own research and having your own opinion is a must on this! I still hold! I have faith! But you may feel different if you want to ride this ride, but we do have a great community that’s supportive! Trust your gut friend!",5,1738021926.0,2025-01-27 23:52:06
1iavpy2,Odd_Action_7418,"Also well noting, the @shibtoken on x, claims to be an official Shiba Inu page. A lot of the original team has claimed it is not and they said that person is has a bunch of accounts, but never named who. I myself, don’t know what to believe, but that page has promoted scam coins that were rugged too and usually they’re the same coins shy promotes. I found it very weird for that page with 3mil followers to be posting those coins like that, and once they get called out after the rug, the posts are deleted. I personally never followed or listen to that page, but it is something to think about.

The idea was to use shib Inu coin as gas fees to help compete against eth high fees and also hopefully lower eth gas fees to a degree. Shibarium was suppose to use shib coins as gas fees for all transactions and lead to those coins used as fees to go to a burn wallet, yet he’s promoting solana coins every week, that magically get rugged and all his promos get deleted off his account.

1jkaor2,CitizenCraigXD,"​As of March 29, 2025, **Shiba Inu (SHIB)** has a market capitalization of approximately **$7.54 billion USD**. A 1% increase in market cap equates to about **$75.4 million USD**.​[Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/price/shiba-inu?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  However, the actual amount of capital required to achieve this 1% price increase depends on several factors:​  * **Liquidity:** Higher liquidity means the market can absorb larger trades without significant price changes.​ * **Order Book Depth:** A deeper order book with substantial buy and sell orders can mitigate price volatility from large trades.​ * **Market Sentiment:** Positive news or trends can amplify price movements, while negative sentiment can dampen them.​  Given SHIB's substantial market cap and trading volume, a direct infusion of $75.4 million USD might not precisely result in a 1% price increase due to these dynamics. The interplay of liquidity, order book depth, and market sentiment means that the actual impact of such an investment can vary. It's also important to note that the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and price movements can be influenced by factors beyond capital inflows.",1,1743262087.0,2025-03-29 15:28:07

But the important point is, from next year, if you for example sell coins at 10X, which you bought at 8X (for a profit of 2X), then the crypto exchange will have to make the IRS aware of the transaction of your sale at a price of 10X.  But If you then don't yourself fill in the form where you can document that you bought it at 8X, then starting next year the IRS will default your initial acquisition price at 0X, meaning you will get taxed as if it was all pure profit instead of getting taxed on 2X.

1hngh0o,MrHobbits,"Exactly. Someone here did the math and said that in order for the supply to actually decrease significantly, so the market cap would reach $5.7T, we would have to reduce the current supply (576T tokens). If we all pitched in and burned at a steady rate, 1 Million tokens every minute, we could reach $0.01 in just over a year.   Financially, the price of SHIB would also rise with the supply being burned at that rate, and become less and less attainable. Unless everyone bought the remaining tokens withing a day or so before everyone knew what was up, which would require our collective efforts to spend roughly $13Billion.   Elon could do it to manipulate the market, upset the entire global market (many of us here would become millionaires), and the next obvious choice would be to sell everything as the price would reach $0.01 and the value of selling would literally be trillions of dollars. However, a buy order of this magnitude would likely also never happen as such an order would drive the price up as the market watchers would see it and act on it quickly.  Essentially, all of that to say in the most sarcastic way possible, ""yay.""  P.s. whales want the little people to burn their tokens so they don't have to. It keeps you poor and hopeful, right where they want you.",2,1735409133.0,2024-12-28 18:05:33

1hmthm7,Aggravating-Bad-9448,"TL;DR  SHIB Daily Projection: Thursday  The market is bearish, with crypto down and strong sell pressure. RSI and STC are oversold, which may attract buyers if prices hold above current levels. Key indicators (ADX, volume) confirm bearish momentum.  Watch for a short-term reversal if RSI rises above 30% or CCI shifts above -100. A break above resistance levels could signal a bullish shift.  Long-term support shows potential drops to $0.00002070, with a max bearish target of $0.00001084. If buying pressure returns, prices could reach $0.00002320.

That’s the .01-.001 window in 5 years. It’s naturally possible if things stay the same. This doesn’t even account for the very real possibility of crypto going mainstream due to a number of factors like another bank bankruptcy scenario, housing crash, war over resources, power shifts in countries, and lack of trust with the people and their financial institutes globally as well as the global market realizing that crypto is a real time stock for cash transaction which removes the power of stock holders and capitalism from controlling the prices. There are millions of variables, but some are drastically more realizable and potential and far from impossible to come into play. This means literally following the hodl principle, investing little by little for long periods, and pulling out of the stock market gradually. It’s a transition period right now in the early stages, battling the current infrastructure of money as king. It’s David vs Goliath and we all know who wins. We just need to expound on the story and have chapter 2 where David turns into Goliath but with all the power and knowledge and skills David possesses. That’s the true king. The best plan is a long marathon. Let politics and greed wring out the last remaining vestiges of financial wealth from those who are hopelessly tied to them. Sit back and let history run its course.
