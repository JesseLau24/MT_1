1kb6lv5,NihilistHUGZ,I have no problem with AI but that would take the fun out of my hobby and I prefer the crayons. There is something about seeing the patterns and the values of different indicators coming together and being able to identify them based on the framework of so many brilliant and passionate people that make up these studies. Their concepts are what I enjoy and like an artist they each created something that is unique and without imitation. It wouldnt be the same if I couldn't try to make my own art and as an artist uses paper I use charts and my methodologies I invent are the artistic expression of my intellect and the reflection of my passion.,1,1746333410.0,2025-05-04 04:36:50
