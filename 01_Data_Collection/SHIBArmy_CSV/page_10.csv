This was like over a year ago? More so, during this last run up a few months ago, we came close to flipping Shiba. One more of those and we will flip Shib and then they are done for.   I mean think about it. It makes sense right? Shiba was made to be the doge killer. Well, that never happened and never will. Also, Pepe is this generations meme coin. I don‚Äôt think it will ever flip Doge but it damn sure is way more popular than Doge now a days.

This was like over a year ago? More so, during this last run up a few months ago, we came close to flipping Shiba. One more of those and we will flip Shib and then they are done for.   I mean think about it. It makes sense right? Shiba was made to be the doge killer. Well, that never happened and never will. Also, Pepe is this generations meme coin. I don‚Äôt think it will ever flip Doge but it damn sure is way more popular than Doge now a days.

Simple explanation u should buy for the lowest you think it would get for shiba inu while sell it when it reach a quarter of penny. a penny is 0.01 while its quarter is 0.0025 shiba curren price to usd is 0.00001522. U sold it if You want to incur the loss lower than the MARKET VALUE of your price bought.  so if you even bought shiba inu in a valuation of .00001625 u already incurred loss.
