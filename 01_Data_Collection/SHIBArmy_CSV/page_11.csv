1ihb238,Secret-Computer-7637,Still the point still stands that Shiba in 2020 nov 28 being sold during 2021 WILL BE MONUMENTAL than btc in a year of investment.  Point is THE TALK ABOUT BEING RICH not average INCREASE OF VALUATION.  Btc 1/1/2020 up to 1/1/2021 from 9k to 37k cad is only 400% increase for value only  not even close to shiba inu 0.000 000 000 010 301  going to  0.000 088 40 is like 6 decimal place gone. 10m% gain was it not really good with math with high numbers but more monumental IF ANYONE GOT THE FORECAST ability to do so.  This would be even similar to XRP REACHING 10K which is only 5 decimal place when ITS ADAPTED GLOBALLY FOR INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER.,1,1738889661.0,2025-02-07 00:54:21

1idz6a7,NihilistHUGZ,Burns will long term be the thing that keeps the value rolling up.  You dont have the right way of looking at the burns. Couple burns with some of our long term utilizations and you will see the burns differently when the supply starts really coming down. I agree that the supply is massive even yet but I have maintained optimism for the future.,4,1738278519.0,2025-01-30 23:08:39
1idz6a7,typeIIcivilization,"Can you clue me in to SHIB? I‚Äôve asked several times here and cannot get an answer on why this is a thing.  From this post, I‚Äôve gathered a ‚Äúfeature‚Äù is ‚Äúburning‚Äù or forever digitally destroying a set amount of SHIB. I‚Äôm assuming there is a finite amount of this stuff.  So I‚Äôm assuming the theory is that over time, people will randomly burn SHIB until the supply continues to come down as price per SHIB increases.  I‚Äôm wondering what motivates a burn and what else I should know.  Basically, why the f*** are you guys rock hard for SHIB.",3,1738287609.0,2025-01-31 01:40:09
1idz6a7,NihilistHUGZ,Its a thing because it started as one of the original MEME tokens and from there it began building an ecosystem that has several mechanisms and other tokens attached which give the ecosystem greater functionality. When the token kept evolving and hitting all the Milestones put forth by the development team it caught my attention. The burns are not something that we do or any one person does it's built into some of the platforms that they've created so for a transaction that occurs on that platform and whatever token a fee is collected and converted to Shiba Inu and so on and so forth. No one has to go take their coins and go burn them or send them to any kind of dead wallet that's already being done for all of us so that's why I'm excited about it is because I don't have to give up any coins and scarcity will happen. Another one that I keep advocating for is for further utilization that finds a way to incorporate the ecosystems for Shiba Inu then it will drive greater burn rates. I've talked quite a bit about this and I wouldn't mind to do some theoretical math here. In the past I've gotten eat up on this conversation but over the past six or seven months I am pretty confident in what I'm talking about,4,1738299875.0,2025-01-31 05:04:35
