1iavpy2,AsgarGER,"Is Shiba Inu (SHIB) Worth It?  1. Basics  Meme coin, launched as a Dogecoin alternative. ERC-20 token on Ethereum, no own blockchain. Mainly speculation-driven, minimal real-world use.   2. Performance &amp; Volatility  Highly volatile, price depends on hype (e.g., Elon Musk, social media). Large market cap but lacks real utility. Burn mechanism introduced, impact uncertain.   3. Future Outlook  Shibarium (Layer-2) aims for faster, cheaper transactions. NFTs &amp; ShibaSwap exist but no major DeFi breakthrough. Competes with Dogecoin, no clear market leadership.   Conclusion  SHIB is more speculation than investment, relying on hype rather than fundamentals. High risk, potential short-term gains, but no long-term value.",2,1738096139.0,2025-01-28 20:28:59

What is your take ? Been in for a long time but never felt people were that bearish before .,1,1737952959.0,2025-01-27 04:42:39
1iavpy2,Odd_Action_7418,"I don‚Äôt want to say I‚Äôm bearish, cause I still have faith in the community, but my hype for it being bullish has faded. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm neutral at this point. I don‚Äôt want to type too long and write an essay. But some things that truly bothered me, was shibarium, there was much hype and anticipation around it, it was gonna bring Shiba Inu coin to kill a zero. Shibarium, well for me it isn‚Äôt, but some people find it very difficult to use (as well as shib.io), same as with some other projects the team has made. Now I know not everything will be perfect off that bat, things take time, but it seems like the last few years they‚Äôve completely forgotten about shibarium, bone, treat, leash. The idea, if I‚Äôm not mistaken, was to be able to list coins onto shibarium, to have projects on it, with as well as the major player to it, Shiba Inu coin being the gas fee for the transactions which would result in those coins used as gas fees going to a burn. Another idea before shibarium came around, was the idea to introduce Shiba Inu coin as an alternative gas fee for eth with vitalek, but I have no idea what happened with that and why that‚Äôs not even talked about anymore(it was one of main things that made me go, hey this a great idea, I‚Äôm willing to invest into this). There has been a huge lack of burning, the most burns we saw are from us, the community/shibarmy and shibtoshi, and when people on X got excited and thank shibtoshi(@shibtoshi on x), shytoshi got really upset about it, post have now been deleted, but he was doing subliminal hate posts towards shibtoshi and some team members who were praising him. I feel I‚Äôm going on too much, but anyways, promoting a bunch of coins on solana is not good look for shibarium. Specially when those coins he promotes, usually gets rugged, and he deletes all the posts promoting them. He promoted the hawk tuah scam, and lot more before it. He promises a lot, but nothing has really happen, other than a few app games (that are suppose to burn shib but I don‚Äôt think they are), he left a bunch of bone, leash, treat holders in the dark.. lot of the original team have been vocal about him on x. I say check them out, see what you think about it, (@shibtoshi is an og huge huge bag owner of shib) but check these og team members and their posts @imrjcyka and @ShibaTrophias , few other pages would be @Shibaholder_  @Labib_co And the official Shiba Inu coin burn @shibburn has called shy out about certain and gave warning to the community as well. @cryptolollla was another account but her account got deactivated and some speculate someone did a bunch of false reporting to get her banned. (Idk if it‚Äôs true or not) it‚Äôs a lot of drama. I know I‚Äôm missing a few things but those were my main reasons. I‚Äôm not anti Shiba Inu coin, I still have my bag that I‚Äôve been holding for years, but I do not like the direction shy has been taking us, if he has even been leading shib to any direction. I still have faith in shibarium, I still have faith in bone, leash, treat etc(which I do not own), I have faith in the community, because we‚Äôre a great community! My advice is, take what you read from this and ask other community members as well! Specially on X! There‚Äôs a great bunch there, I believe in doing your own research and having your own opinion is a must on this! I still hold! I have faith! But you may feel different if you want to ride this ride, but we do have a great community that‚Äôs supportive! Trust your gut friend!",5,1738021926.0,2025-01-27 23:52:06

A lot of the original team has claimed it is not and they said that person is has a bunch of accounts, but never named who. I myself, don‚Äôt know what to believe, but that page has promoted scam coins that were rugged too and usually they‚Äôre the same coins shy promotes. I found it very weird for that page with 3mil followers to be posting those coins like that, and once they get called out after the rug, the posts are deleted. I personally never followed or listen to that page, but it is something to think about.

And if you took your own advice chatgbt shows several wrong, so I would not believe everything you read. It clearly states you can trade shib for acceptable coins to the cash. That‚Äôs not currency, tradable. So stop pumping what does not exist. Hopefully in the future if you so called investors stop pumping with hype and started accurately putting your money where yours mouths are and maybe accepting on your own websites. And maybe stop treating these meme coins as lotto tickets. Maybe these will start to have value, tangible useful value. BTC, ETH have utility values people use them DAILY.
