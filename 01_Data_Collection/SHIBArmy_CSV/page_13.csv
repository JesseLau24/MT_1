How people will react from a 4 years old project wen other project with low mc, lower supply could bring more for investor. Shib already pump big and 20 billions market ca still very big.  One of the reason people stay is they are at lost from ATH.  Some wait for the 1$ that will never happen while some believe holding 1 millions will make them millionnaire wen they don't understand the liquidity attach to it.  Wen you look at it with cold mind you understand that it was delusionnal to become rich.  If you invest don't look at the price it mean nothing. Instead look at the % gain your money get and if you will be happy with it sell it wen you reach your target.    More higher mc are, the more money you need to invest to grab more. It not the usual working class that will profit most but the whale.  I went to crypto with some hope and after 5 years i realise the illusion million of people been throught.    Keeping a strategy is important and the one i use is DCA.  At the end for the no trader that what could pay off. With less risk. And dont hesitate to sell to secure some gain even if your hoping for more. Better to have some secure gain than big lost.",2,1737330099.0,2025-01-19 23:41:39

Whales manipulate the price up and down and use us guys to buy their Lamborghini’s and toys.     I have made money and am exiting out.    Enough is enough.,1,1737164345.0,2025-01-18 01:39:05

1i297bz,blankline9,yall converting shib to xrp are a little late to the game. but better late then never.  been in xrp since late december 2019 just before it was delisted on american exchanges due to SEC nonsense.  i continued to buy a little more as time went on but most of what i am holding i got in at .19-.29.  i want more but it's going to kill my DCA to start buying more when it's over $3.  doesn't really matter though if the long term potential is what i think it is.  This shit is going to make a lot more people rich than what the shit coin shib will.,3,1737036717.0,2025-01-16 14:11:57
