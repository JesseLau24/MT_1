1i2d735,artdirror,"Guys, let’s break this down. We’re talking about an ERC-20 token with a $14 billion market cap. Swapping through the ETH network is expensive because of gas fees, and XRP is essentially a dinosaur coin with the 4th largest market cap. Unless you’re an insider or ridiculously wealthy, no one truly knows how price fluctuations will play out.    You can analyze charts all day, but if big money pulls out, that’s it—value disappears. A $50 investment in something with such a large market cap isn’t going to make anyone rich overnight. Understanding these dynamics might help bring some peace to folks in this sub who seem confused or frustrated.    At the end of the day, investments are all about leverage and timing, no matter the asset. I personally like SHIB, but sometimes we like things that might not be as popular anymore—it happens. Arguing over it doesn’t help anyone. If you’ve already invested, just hold on—you never know what might happen.    What do y’all think?",9,1737129041.0,2025-01-17 15:50:41
1i2d735,armhanson,"If there’s going to be any real movement, it’s going to be massive. But that’s not going to happen soon. It’s silly to sell now unless you’ve invested thousands, which is also silly. You don’t need to invest a lot to make a massive amount of money on these things. You just need patience. I took away 300,000% gains in ’21 with doge. That was after selling in ’19. I could have waited and sold for 30,000,000% gains. This coin will jump as well. People who say it won’t are a part of the joke that is the fuel for all meme coins. And that is the wisdom of the doge. You can take it for fact or scoff at it. The outcome remains the same.",4,1737104091.0,2025-01-17 08:54:51

1i0i9v8,Sad_Kaleidoscope3286,"I don't think crypto is following a straight logic tbh and I don't think you can tied it to real world inflation, that's kinda decorrelated. I would be more looking at what money flow could come massively and from where. 5 years from now, states will stop wondering whether they should have a BTC safety stock, they'll all have. Also co sider that the Blockchain has not at all taped into the real world yet. Once it has, that will increase the number of transaction and I crypto, usage brings price up. For me the main barrier is the market cap that has to be consistent with other major cryptos like BTC. Of BTC hits a million or so in 10 years, then it might be possible to hit 0.1 and more if SHIB is still around in a decade (which could be of we stick to what the team is developing.

1i0i9v8,Sad_Kaleidoscope3286,"Supply of SHIB is deflationnary on the contrary + it turned the meme side of things a while back ago. Although I don't think it will hit 1$ either, but that's not the point I think. Although as for any alts the multiplier is also much stronger or can be at least so it can't really be compared to BTC on that point.  End of the day the good portfolio is made of a good mix, differentiated based on everyone's beliefs and risk taking ability. But definitely not a good thing to put all saving on risky bets. On my side I find the SHIB project interesting so it is more like project support more than multiplier expectation, if I want that I just put money in ETFs.",1,1736933792.0,2025-01-15 09:36:32
