1hwn2sz,Feeling-Screwed,"There‚Äôs a possibility that it grows into more use cases, but for now it‚Äôs still just a meme and its utility based projects are not widely known enough for people to pump it the way they pump something like DOGE.   The circulating supply is also still really high in the hundreds of trillions, which will ultimately keep the price under a cent. The current burn mechanisms don‚Äôt seem to be burning enough, but we‚Äôll see if any surprises happen.   TLDR; unlikely to hit a cent in the next 5 years, or even 15 in my opinion.

1hvyrbf,The_GOAT_Collector,"Shiba Inu‚Äôs Future Value Requires Aggressive Burns or Bone Integration.  If Shiba Inu is ever to achieve exponential value, it requires a massive and consistent burn strategy‚Äîperiod. Burning trillions of tokens annually is the only way to reduce the overwhelming supply that holds back its price potential. Without it, the dream of significant value appreciation remains just that‚Äîa dream.  Another viable approach could be integrating Bone into the ecosystem more strategically, creating synergies that enhance utility and encourage burns indirectly.  But let's be clear: if Shiba Inu hasn‚Äôt burned at least 200 trillion tokens over the next decade, it will be a colossal failure. The supply is simply too massive to sustain any realistic price growth without drastic measures.  It‚Äôs time for the community and developers to recognize that without an aggressive burn mechanism or innovative solutions like Bone, we risk losing the momentum that makes this project exciting.

While initially perceived as a meme coin, SHIB is evolving into a more utility-focused project with a strong community at its core.",45,1735957069.0,2025-01-04 02:17:49

1ht3rmy,Viktory_Sport,"You're welcome! üòä  SHIB primarily operates on the **Ethereum base layer**, but it‚Äôs evolving to leverage Layer 2 solutions to improve scalability, transaction speed, and reduce gas fees. The SHIB ecosystem has introduced **Shibarium**, its native Layer 2 blockchain, which is designed to address these limitations.  Here‚Äôs what to know about SHIB‚Äôs Layer 2 support and interoperability:  1. **Shibarium (Layer 2):**    * Shibarium is built to scale SHIB and its ecosystem by offering a high-speed, low-cost network for transactions.    * It's focused on powering applications like ShibaSwap, gaming (e.g., Shiba Inu Metaverse), and DeFi projects. 2. **Interoperability:**    * While Shibarium is the primary Layer 2 focus, the SHIB ecosystem has shown adaptability. For instance, SHIB tokens can be bridged to other Layer 2s like **Polygon (MATIC)** or **Arbitrum** through third-party solutions or partnerships.    * Additionally, **Binance Smart Chain (BSC)** has supported SHIB for token transfers via bridges, offering a multi-chain presence. 3. **Community-Driven Expansions:**    * SHIB‚Äôs future could involve broader Layer 2 compatibility or integration into more blockchains depending on community and developer interest.  The move to Layer 2 (e.g., Shibarium) is a strategic step to ensure SHIB remains relevant, efficient, and widely usable as blockchain technology evolves.",9,1735957930.0,2025-01-04 02:32:10

1hsu63j,basterdbastion,"Hello u/ELISHA_COIN, I just checked over your YT account and it seems that you are a real person, putting your authentic self out here and have true conviction in this price point.     I was just wondering what are your opinions on why SHIB has the potential for a 15x surge in the next year. To be clear, I do actually agree somewhat with this price point from my own DD. This is not a troll or shit post. I would very much like to hear what in your research has led you to this conclusion and if you have any TA or mathematical information you believe supports your thesis.   Thank you.",3,1735959623.0,2025-01-04 03:00:23
1hsu63j,ELISHA_COIN,"TA means nothing.. it is only a reference point, but does not guarantee returns. Additionally, TA and trends can reverse in a split second from a single article or negative PR from various sources.   Additionally... Who said anything about  a 15x? If SHIB is going to 15x this year, that is news to me.  If you have watched my videos you would understand the reason I believe SHIB will hit ATH and beyond this year.   I take a lot of time to make the video's so everyone has the information.",-2,1735965511.0,2025-01-04 04:38:31
1hsu63j,basterdbastion,"Okay,, thank you for your response. I would reconsider your stance on traditional TA and mathematical charting. While it is definitely not the end all, be all, it is also definitely worthwhile to know and watch.   The reason I mentioned 15x was your post above and video shows 1550.20%, that would be a 15x move.   Good luck on your investing journey.",5,1735967519.0,2025-01-04 05:11:59
1hsu63j,ELISHA_COIN,"No problem.   I don't discourage TA, but it gets annoying when individuals give predictions based on their TA and a short report, or a regulation comes out that changes everything. I encourage research.  The 15x is good marketing... However if the video was watched, it would be more apparent what I am actually talking about.
