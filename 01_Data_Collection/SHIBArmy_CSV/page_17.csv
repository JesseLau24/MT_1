1hobsru,xtanol,"Since it essentially closes a tax loophole, it could mean that there will be a dip in crypto value on the day before new years - since it's the last chance to sell crypto while the reporting of income is up to the individual (which some interpret as ""voluntary"").   But the important point is, from next year, if you for example sell coins at 10X, which you bought at 8X (for a profit of 2X), then the crypto exchange will have to make the IRS aware of the transaction of your sale at a price of 10X.  But If you then don't yourself fill in the form where you can document that you bought it at 8X, then starting next year the IRS will default your initial acquisition price at 0X, meaning you will get taxed as if it was all pure profit instead of getting taxed on 2X.

1hngh0o,MrHobbits,"Exactly. Someone here did the math and said that in order for the supply to actually decrease significantly, so the market cap would reach $5.7T, we would have to reduce the current supply (576T tokens). If we all pitched in and burned at a steady rate, 1 Million tokens every minute, we could reach $0.01 in just over a year.   Financially, the price of SHIB would also rise with the supply being burned at that rate, and become less and less attainable. Unless everyone bought the remaining tokens withing a day or so before everyone knew what was up, which would require our collective efforts to spend roughly $13Billion.   Elon could do it to manipulate the market, upset the entire global market (many of us here would become millionaires), and the next obvious choice would be to sell everything as the price would reach $0.01 and the value of selling would literally be trillions of dollars. However, a buy order of this magnitude would likely also never happen as such an order would drive the price up as the market watchers would see it and act on it quickly.  Essentially, all of that to say in the most sarcastic way possible, ""yay.""  P.s. whales want the little people to burn their tokens so they don't have to.

1hmthm7,Aggravating-Bad-9448,"TL;DR  SHIB Daily Projection: Thursday  The market is bearish, with crypto down and strong sell pressure. RSI and STC are oversold, which may attract buyers if prices hold above current levels. Key indicators (ADX, volume) confirm bearish momentum.  Watch for a short-term reversal if RSI rises above 30% or CCI shifts above -100. A break above resistance levels could signal a bullish shift.  Long-term support shows potential drops to $0.00002070, with a max bearish target of $0.00001084. If buying pressure returns, prices could reach $0.00002320.

That‚Äôs the .01-.001 window in 5 years. It‚Äôs naturally possible if things stay the same. This doesn‚Äôt even account for the very real possibility of crypto going mainstream due to a number of factors like another bank bankruptcy scenario, housing crash, war over resources, power shifts in countries, and lack of trust with the people and their financial institutes globally as well as the global market realizing that crypto is a real time stock for cash transaction which removes the power of stock holders and capitalism from controlling the prices. There are millions of variables, but some are drastically more realizable and potential and far from impossible to come into play. This means literally following the hodl principle, investing little by little for long periods, and pulling out of the stock market gradually. It‚Äôs a transition period right now in the early stages, battling the current infrastructure of money as king. It‚Äôs David vs Goliath and we all know who wins. We just need to expound on the story and have chapter 2 where David turns into Goliath but with all the power and knowledge and skills David possesses. That‚Äôs the true king.
