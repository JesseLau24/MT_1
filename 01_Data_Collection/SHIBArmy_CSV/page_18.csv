1hm2spi,Backieotamy,Shib survives by the hopes and dreams of us poor folk. it's not steeped in reality but in rockets.,16,1735142308.0,2024-12-25 15:58:28
1hm2spi,basterdbastion,"It's about adoption, plus the burns, plus the movement of BTC &amp; ETH,  plus global market cap increasing, plus M2 monetary supply, plus inflation, Quantitative easing. ETC....  I am not advocating or even implying that Shib is going to 1 cent. I don't think it will in the next 5 years, but it's not completely impossible. Getting to 0.001 is much more feasible though.   The people only focusing on burns or saying it's impossible because of supply, DO NOT understand how the market works.   Shib will still do very well in 2025, based on the whole crypto market growing in market cap and adoption. Invest only what you can afford to lose in any cryptocurrency.

1hm2spi,Chemical_Salad4709,Not gonna happen. Still a good idea to hold a few just in case something happens in the future tho. Always keep some sanity tokens,3,1735154404.0,2024-12-25 19:20:04
1hm2spi,ChampOfSon,"But Doge won't be burning enough of their supply to go to $100K per coin like Bitcoin either. Why are we so focused on this?  All that matters is the value going up or down. Price per coin can't be compared to different cryptos with extremely different supplies.  Take Yen, for example. The total circulating supply of Yen is 124.6 trillion yen. Each 1 Yen is worth $0.00636. You'd have to burn nearly 123.9 Trillion Yen for 1 Yen to equal 1 Dollar.  But no one is obsessed with that.",3,1735163424.0,2024-12-25 21:50:24
1hm2spi,MaxIsSaltyyyy,"They won‚Äôt. Burns are just a hype thing and barely any of the supply has actually been burned since release. Shib will never be able to reach 1 cent, it is impossible. Even hitting .001 is likely never going to happen.",8,1735141392.0,2024-12-25 15:43:12

1hm2spi,crayZEN_2r,"its not necessarily ""they"", remember due to all the hype and such many normal individual have put their life savings into Shib i.e. 100s of millions and some claim over a billion shib.   The question you need to ask yourself is at some point if you put it all in, will you be willing to burn $12K of shib to pick up the price for your balance and everyone else which won't be seen immediately.  this is the problem we find ourselves in as not many are willing to burn their cash and want to become multi millionaires off shib.. realistically i dont think it will happen in the near future. its probably a multi decade hodl i.e. you will have happy grand or great grand kids; if they don't lose interest",1,1735282331.0,2024-12-27 06:52:11
