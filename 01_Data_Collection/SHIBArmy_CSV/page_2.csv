1k2egfo,nycstockup,What is good entry price that has support I wanna buy,1,1745084445.0,2025-04-19 17:40:45
1k2egfo,NihilistHUGZ,Right now we have long-term and short-term neutral major pivot Points converging meaning that the support and resistance walls are well defined showing a bottom. If you're looking for a good buy in then I would take whatever your current Target entry price is and then look at the average true range for a long-term time frame which sets price movements at a typical current level of $0.00000096. So if we take today's average neutral level based on my algorithm we get $0.00001204. So a move below that that would be to $0.00001108 for lowest possible entry target and a move above would be $0.00001300. When I do my day trading I use ATR movements for quick insight and that would mean using my method your entry range to choose a buy postion rests within $0.00001108 to $0.00001300. Of you buy nearer to the top then you bought the short term top of the long term bottom. If you buy nearer to $0.00001108 then you are buying the short term bottom of the long term bottom. I can explain this out however you need so if this is a little confusing just let me know,1,1745095433.0,2025-04-19 20:43:53
1k2egfo,NihilistHUGZ,Also part of my trading strategy that I have put together over a few years is to incorporate into your entry strategy a straddle. Take whatever Capital you intend to invest and only inject 50% at any point within that range I gave you. Then follow it and DCA 30% when you see a strong dip and the remaining 20% keep DCA through every dip you see on down days until you're able to inject 100% of the capital into that investment. This will allow you to play a longer entry strategy and capture lower averages rather than taking the entire lump and throwing it in.,1,1745095639.0,2025-04-19 20:47:19

Well, what if you invest on your own and play the crypto market? Now I'm not saying to do it this way...but add this strategy. SHIB then has millions of potential bag holders that collectively is the DOG POUND. We all hold a large portion. But based on volatility, you still need to use the other wallet to gain more SHIB. We hodlers are the owners of the dog pound. When businesses find the value of this, then things will get interesting for all of us.",1,1744472695.0,2025-04-12 15:44:55

Talked to the bot and we are looking to flip 3 to 5 percent every cycle. The bot told me how many times it would take to compound the interest to match  what I got in the first wallet. I have to wait for the downturn to buy and the wait to sell at 3 percent. The fact that people panic and sell thier stuff so fast made me realize I can make a quick buck. What it also does is allow me to build the SHIB over time since that's all I seem to have nowadays...is time.,0,1744314041.0,2025-04-10 19:40:41
