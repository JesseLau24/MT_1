1jkaor2,CitizenCraigXD,"‚ÄãAs of March 29, 2025, **Shiba Inu (SHIB)** has a market capitalization of approximately **$7.54 billion USD**. A 1% increase in market cap equates to about **$75.4 million USD**.‚Äã[Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/price/shiba-inu?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  However, the actual amount of capital required to achieve this 1% price increase depends on several factors:‚Äã  * **Liquidity:** Higher liquidity means the market can absorb larger trades without significant price changes.‚Äã * **Order Book Depth:** A deeper order book with substantial buy and sell orders can mitigate price volatility from large trades.‚Äã * **Market Sentiment:** Positive news or trends can amplify price movements, while negative sentiment can dampen them.‚Äã  Given SHIB's substantial market cap and trading volume, a direct infusion of $75.4 million USD might not precisely result in a 1% price increase due to these dynamics. The interplay of liquidity, order book depth, and market sentiment means that the actual impact of such an investment can vary. It's also important to note that the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and price movements can be influenced by factors beyond capital inflows.",1,1743262087.0,2025-03-29 15:28:07

1jjn6l4,CALINXD94,"I mean if we break past .00005 we might see it and hype should be also at 100% otherwise, I hope it goes bafk to at least 25b MC, I'm was literally Up like 250% in march last yr and I didnt sell, I put another 25k$ in november and I'm down lol what a clown I am.. but still I'll buy a few more in a few days to level UP dca and once we hit 20b mc ill be up a bit and will sell majority...      Something I have seen and ppl als ohave seen is that times are differnt in crypto NOW and is only been 4 yrs since 2021, NOW everyones just tryna use u as EL, meme coins are literally rug pulls now.. cant even hold for a few weeks!",1,1742946407.0,2025-03-25 23:46:47
1jjn6l4,ArtInfinite5179,And true there are alot shit coins but I don‚Äôt think this is one of them cause as time goes on and shib is still relevant it‚Äôll become less volatile as coins are burned and MC is maintained,2,1742948095.0,2025-03-26 00:14:55
1jjn6l4,ArtInfinite5179,Personally I would be more than happy to see it hit 0.00005 cause that would be a big win cause I suspect it to go back down during the summer low 0.00001 and take off during fall so I‚Äôll put in a lot more during the summer time,1,1742948013.0,2025-03-26 00:13:33

1jjn6l4,ArtInfinite5179,Based on the previous cycle shib took off towards end of October and doge took off in may those are the only 2 I really know about. But a lot has changed since then with the hype and political side of things so who knows shib might take off early,2,1742963706.0,2025-03-26 04:35:06

1jjn6l4,StreetlightM22,Serious question. Why would you think everything would go well with the incomplete team in charge and the massive uncertainty in the global economy?,0,1743283373.0,2025-03-29 21:22:53

1jjn6l4,utterbbq2,People said back in 2021 it would reach 0.01 by the end of that year lol.   Shib is still lika 80% down from ATH so I think you should focus on that first.,1,1742945450.0,2025-03-25 23:30:50
1jjn6l4,ArtInfinite5179,ATH was in October‚Ä¶ so yea I can see why we are still down 80% lol and I doubt it‚Äôll reach 0.01 anytime soon unless someone really hates money and burns a few hundred million dollars.  But if you read my post again I said 0.00008-0.0001 not 0.01. I feel like my target price is a lot more realistic than 1 cent,1,1742946130.0,2025-03-25 23:42:10

1jjn6l4,ArtInfinite5179,Market can change within a blink of an eye. And recently we have been seeing good news with bitcoin and markets in general. Markets adjust to change and eventually go up again. Once fed rates are cut things will be a whole lot brighter. Shib has a few more months before it has its run and a lot can happen from now to then so who knows maybe we will drop a 0,1,1742932849.0,2025-03-25 20:00:49

As far as getting validation from reddit for your next purchase, I would recommend doing your own diligence and not letting your bias get in the way. If you believe in it, then buy it, but I'll wait, keep accumulating cash for the right time. If warren buffet says buy, you better believe I'll be buying.",2,1742933586.0,2025-03-25 20:13:06
