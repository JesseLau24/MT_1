Can't study or learn any skills coz said job takes most of my time. It's literally impossible for me to live off 2 weeks check I can barely survive with full pay check.  2. Need capital to flip  3. Still need capital  4. Tried that when I was younger with my uncle, he died and I don't want to get a criminal record, I got too many dependents.  5. Can't do Nomad coz of said dependents.  6. Joined a cult, it's called church but the tried to take from me instead of giving.  7. Scamming sounds worse than robbing people. It also requires a bit of time, cpu and ram (I don't even remember what I ate for lunch today) which I don't have.  8. Money could and would never become a useless token to me. Too many dependents that I wish to keep alive. I would literally become a hitman (I need connections for that, I tried to find clients already) for them.",2,1742920281.0,2025-03-25 16:31:21

I guess being in crypto for many years now these cycles don't surprise me. I am however certain that this one's different &amp; matter how good at techs it's still completely unpredictable. Shib has made me a lot of money, it's low cost enough to mess with and if you don't need it just keep an eye on it. The difference in % where BTC is vs a lot of alts is not locked in correlation which makes you wonder if BTC backs down into the 70s where the hell are alta going?ü§î A lot are at lows so does that mean alt season begins or do they follow BTC and drop lower than pre cycle? I will say this is how I figured it would go hype fades coins die but doge lasts &amp; imo shib will last. It's too big and there's a lot at work. Get yourselves to a point in price where you have enough that you don't need it to moon for yourself to take big profits. We've already got bags of it. You know it's going to go up and down. If you don't, trust us. It will. Swap to stable on a pump, swap back in a drops and multiply holdings lowering your avg cost and one big pump later cha ching, again!

It‚Äôs is a USELESS coin that solves nothing financially.   4. Sure we know. It‚Äôs right in the toilet exactly where it went down after the pump and dump in ‚Äò21. It‚Äôs never recovered, nor will it ever.   5. It‚Äôs easily predictable. It has zero usage and most of these worthless coins are artificially pumped and then dumped for major profits to those controlling the majority of the coins.

These cryptos will keep gaining value whether you like it or not, that‚Äôs just the way it is. Doge will do the same, before last bullrun it sat at .002 forever then boom, .74 cents. Crypto will be here for a very long time bud, you screaming calling people scammers isn‚Äôt going to stop anything. The next transfer of wealth from the older generation to the newer generation will be injected into the crypto market. That‚Äôs just the way it is. I‚Äôm not saying crypto is the only thing you should invest in, I believe real estate is the best investment out there. However, crypto being so volatile is a high risk/high reward play, when you watch the market cycles over the course of years you can time it so that you buy when it‚Äôs low and sell when it‚Äôs high. People trade every day in the stock market for profit whether it be buying long, short positions and options. Crypto is the same shit just more volatile. The only way crypto will go away is if Satoshi wakes up and cashes out his millions of BTC and completely destroys the price. That‚Äôs literally what it would take.

1jedb9r,CAN-SUX-IT,Whales leaving is the best thing ever for Shib! The huge holders are the ones who use algorithmic trading programs that harvest money for themselves but It keeps the price suppressed for the rest of us. Whales using algorithmic trading programs are losing their asses in Shib! The problem is there‚Äôs so much Shib and so little owned. 80% of Shiba Inu has never been bought.  It‚Äôs just sitting there unowned and there‚Äôs so much Shib still waiting it makes it difficult for the automated trading platforms to work. Plus the amount of whales that were manipulating Shib was disrupting others who used algorithmic trading programs. So if we see another zero drop we‚Äôll see the whales coming back.
