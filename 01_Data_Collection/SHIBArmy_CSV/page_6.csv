1jcuxfm,NihilistHUGZ,"The burn is not just a simple action like you may think. Its exists as a Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559 utilization to establish a base fee and that base fee is converted by a fixed percentage to SHIB and burned.

1jcuxfm,bigbadcoinwolf,"SCORCH isn‚Äôt trying to replace **EIP-1559** or the base fee burn mechanism‚Äîit‚Äôs designed to **complement SHIB‚Äôs existing burns** by enabling **community-driven, verifiable burns** outside of network fees.  Everything in SCORCH is **on-chain, transparent, and fully auditable**‚Äîanyone can check the smart contracts and burn records. It‚Äôs not about trusting a third party, but **empowering the community to take action** instead of waiting for SHIB leadership to act.  If SHIB‚Äôs team officially adopts SCORCH, great.

1jcuxfm,NihilistHUGZ,But that's why I say it sounds scammy is due to the fact that the eip-1559 protocol built into the SHIB ecosystem already offers the ability for users to transparently see the accumulation of BONE which dictates when the burn can happen after BONE reaches a point of 100 being accumulated. Right now it's averaging out to a little over 12 million SHIB once that BONE is converted but anyone with a wallet that contains she but Inu can connect to the ecosystem and initiate a burn when they see it's over 100. Also there are groups in the ecosystem which you can Bridge your Shiba Inu tokens 2 and they will initiate Burns based upon Community input.  Scorch is trying to do something that already exists and that is like saying when I go to the bathroom Scorch will be there to wipe my booty for me. I can do that myself and the ecosystem Shiba Inu has which utilizes the EIP-1559 protocol gives me the ability manually as well as other bridged groups.   I just really want you to consider how it sounds. Scorch wants a person to sign up so that they can initiate a burn for you or provide a community for Shiba Inu to burn Shiba Inu when you can already do that yourself. It sounds to me like Scorch is a new token that is trying to capitalize on the existing successful community and gather users to think that it's going to generate more burns when in fact it will not generate any more than the ecosystem already allows and because of the way the development team created the burn mechanism so BUILT-IN Scorch is redundant so even if it is really it will fail because the utilization makes no long term sense and when investors realize the redundancy it will lose positive sentiment and fail within one year.,2,1742158899.0,2025-03-16 21:01:39
1jcuxfm,bigbadcoinwolf,"I see where you're coming from, but SCORCH isn't trying to replace SHIB‚Äôs EIP-1559 burn mechanism‚Äîit‚Äôs designed to enhance and expand it by making burns more frequent, decentralized, and incentivized. The fact that SHIB‚Äôs burn system exists doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt be improved or supported by additional tools.  SHIB's current burn model relies on network fees and manual execution, meaning burns happen at a fixed rate and only when conditions are met. SCORCH introduces a community-driven, gamified approach where burns aren‚Äôt just passive or occasional but active, continuous, and rewarding for participants.  You mentioned that SHIB holders can already burn manually‚Äîtrue, but how many actually do it? SCORCH removes friction and encourages participation by giving users real incentives through rewards, competitions, and staking mechanisms.  It‚Äôs not about ‚Äúwiping for you‚Äù but about creating a system where burns happen organically at scale, without waiting for BONE accumulation, developer actions, or limited community-led events. SCORCH doesn‚Äôt force anyone to sign up‚Äîit simply provides another layer of burn efficiency and engagement that SHIB alone doesn‚Äôt currently leverage.  New ideas and tools don‚Äôt mean something is redundant‚Äîjust like Uniswap didn‚Äôt replace centralized exchanges, SCORCH complements SHIB‚Äôs ecosystem and makes burning a more dynamic and engaging process. If SHIB already had fully automated, community-driven, incentivized burns, SCORCH wouldn‚Äôt need to exist. But it doesn‚Äôt‚Äîso there‚Äôs room for improvement.",1,1742159636.0,2025-03-16 21:13:56
1jcuxfm,bigbadcoinwolf,"SCORCH is more than just a SHIB burn tool, it‚Äôs a system designed to make burning easier, automatic, and rewarding while expanding beyond Shiba Inu.    While Shiba‚Äôs ecosystem allows manual burns, most users don‚Äôt actively participate. SCORCH also adds gamification that encourages community participation through quests, challenges, and incentives that go beyond just burning SHIB. Unlike simple burn portals, SCORCH creates a self-sustaining ecosystem where burns happen passively, users are rewarded for engagement, and additional utilities are introduced.      More importantly, SCORCH isn‚Äôt limited to SHIB, it‚Äôs designed to integrate with other projects and ecosystems, making it a broader burning and engagement platform rather than just another Shiba burn¬†initiative.",2,1742160583.0,2025-03-16 21:29:43

1jcs0r6,Mr_Lightspeed98,"You do not understand how burns work.  Your calculation misunderstands how token burns actually influence crypto prices. Burning tokens by sending them to a dead wallet reduces the total possible supply, but price is driven by active market demand and the circulating supply actively available for trading‚Äînot simply the total number of coins existing.   Even if you burned trillions of inactive tokens, it wouldn‚Äôt automatically push Shiba Inu‚Äôs price to one penny unless demand significantly increased or tradable liquidity was sharply reduced. Your assumption that removing tokens directly and proportionally raises price reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of how crypto markets work.",17,1742152548.0,2025-03-16 19:15:48
1jcs0r6,freedom_fighting321,"If you write a burn contract directly removing the tokens from being counted as an on chain tally,  you definitely can change the price with very large burns.   Yes,  it would take a fuk ton of cash, or a very large mechanic via staking or something to accumulate and do large contract burns.    The contract burns is why the total on chain # isn't a nice round number.   Sending to a dead wallet doesn't effect the price as you would think it would immediately.      And yes,  you still need buyers and sellers to ultimately help the price jump on a burn.   Burning 100 trillion tokens at once via contract should in fact jump the price nearly instantly,  the price per token would reflect the immediate removal of circulated supply even if the market cap does not change.

1jcs0r6,Mr_Lightspeed98,"You‚Äôre conflating the technical mechanism of supply reduction with its economic impact on price.  A ‚Äútrue burn‚Äù‚Äîwhich Shiba Inu does not have and cannot implement without redeploying its original smart contract‚Äîpermanently deletes tokens from the blockchain, explicitly reducing the total supply directly on-chain. In contrast, sending tokens to a dead wallet doesn‚Äôt delete them explicitly; it simply locks them away permanently. Although this doesn‚Äôt technically change the total on-chain supply number, it effectively achieves the same economic result: these tokens are permanently removed from active circulation.  The primary advantage of a true burn is both technical and psychological‚Äîit transparently confirms supply reduction directly on-chain, which can boost investor confidence and market sentiment. However, economically speaking, both burning methods are functionally identical: tokens are permanently unavailable for trading regardless of how they‚Äôre removed.  **HERE IS THE IMPORTANT PART**  Here‚Äôs the critical nuance: neither burning method automatically impacts token price unless the action directly affects the liquidity pools or market demand. Crypto token prices on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap are determined exclusively by the tokens actively available within liquidity pools. Specifically, price is determined by the ratio of tokens to their paired asset (e.g., SHIB to ETH) in these pools.  Burning tokens that aren‚Äôt actively trading‚Äîtokens outside of liquidity pools‚Äîdoes not alter this ratio, and thus won‚Äôt immediately or automatically change the token‚Äôs price. While token burns can influence investor psychology and potentially drive long-term demand indirectly, the immediate market price calculation depends exclusively on active liquidity, not merely total on-chain supply.  Therefore, tokens held outside liquidity pools, whether burned via a true burn or sent to a dead wallet, are economically irrelevant to the immediate pricing mechanism.  To learn more, research the math behind automated market makers as they are the ground truth for pricing.",1,1742169536.0,2025-03-16 23:58:56

If you take as a hypothetical future base valuation for SHIB and the ecosystem the current valuation of BTC the burns could be extremely impactful to cost and scarcity. Think about this:   If SHIB has a market cap of $7.77 billion and 123330500 tokens are burned upon each 100 BONE it works out like this   12330500 / $7770000000 = 0.001586 tokens burned roughly per day per $ of market cap   Now lets factor that down with BTC by market caps   1.65 / 7.77 = 0.2122 proportionally  0.2122 * 1000 = 212.2 factor rate  212.2 * 12330500 = 2616532100 future tokens per burn initiated   Going even further in to hypothetical proportionality¬†   212.2 factor * $0.00001322 (Current SHIB Price) = $0.00281 per token if the market cap of SHIB gets to the current $1.65 trillion market cap of BTC and that would only require industrial and governmental levels of utilization of the current ecosystem to generate burns over several years.

1jc4g10,Mr_Lightspeed98,"  I get where you‚Äôre coming from, but the math around burning tokens isn‚Äôt quite that simple. Here‚Äôs the thing:   ‚Ä¢ Burning tokens reduces supply, but price only rises if demand stays steady or increases.  ‚Ä¢ Your analogy of burning half the world‚Äôs money wouldn‚Äôt double everyone‚Äôs wealth; it‚Äôd create panic, economic instability, and loss of trust. To make everyone twice as rich, you take that half from half the people and give it to the other half.  ‚Ä¢ Token prices rely on many factors‚Äîdemand, utility, trust, and overall market conditions not just scarcity alone.  So, burning tokens can sometimes help, but it definitely doesn‚Äôt always guarantee higher value.",3,1742072819.0,2025-03-15 21:06:59
1jc4g10,Brandine04,"The burn will work at its current rate in about 60 years.

The funny part is that if enough people participated, then everyone could sacrifice as little as $1 a week.  Sadly, it will never happen because of greed and a lack of understanding.",2,1742081388.0,2025-03-15 23:29:48
1jc4g10,NihilistHUGZ,"This in general is the way it needs to be understood. You cannot use the example of burning half the world's money because there is no expectancy for our money to be burned. There is however the expectancy of a burn mechanism built into the ecosystem to function properly. The best way to think about this is in fact about the math but to expand further and add in the hypothetical expansions and utilizations.  If you had several different countries with entire sectors of industry using Shiba Inu and the ecosystem it would in turn accelerate the burn rate. Scarcity does create value outright but also the burn mechanism acts as a deflationary mechanism as well for economies that could use it as a store of value to fight other traditional asset class inflation.  Large community projects can be generated and voted upon to remove tokens in other ways but essentially the ecosystem has already built it in for a long term way to create store of value.  Greater utilization of the current ecosystems and as those ecosystems improving, will enhance utilizations as well creating a cycle which will improve the burns and so on and so forth... Long term goals!   You have to stop thinking of the now and your preconceptions of what the burn mechanism is and begin understanding the built-in aspect for the ecosystem and what that actually entails. When you understand the ecosystem then you can begin to understand the hypothetics of utilizations. It's a great thing.",1,1742074312.0,2025-03-15 21:31:52

If say 150,000 of those members are active and buy/sell shib and each member was to burn 10,000 to 100,000 coins per 1 million coins purchased then you would see a dramatic burn rate in the 30 to 50 billion range. When the crypto community gets wind of that, they will buy or buy and help burn, which will cause more people to buy, and both the burn and FOMO effect will cause the price to rise.  The problem is getting people who don't mind a small loss for greater gains.

So then volume is individually released, lowering the value until it is no longer profitable to each person intending to do so - a last one out is a rotten egg moment, and some will even take the losses because they just have no clue.

I did not even bothering claiming my bone because it would cost more. Instead just reclaimed my Bone.  On positive note. The Shib Land is finally making some traction.

This was before Shibarium and the core team that promoted it apologized for RV not living up to their promises.

Use Azure for their cloud services...etc. Microsoft is arguably making a much bigger killing that route, becoming a critical component of their infrastructure than by just selling a single product to the UAE.
