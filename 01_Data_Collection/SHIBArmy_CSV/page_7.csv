1j2uo5g,Victorvnv,"Not really, it‚Äôs all air and nothing else .   First off putting 5-10 coins most of them centralized means there won‚Äôt be any clear direction outside random buying of coins and putting them in a wallet   Second of all most of these coins are centralized. That means that the companies behind them already have huge reserves and will likely low ball the retailers by offering huge OTC deals with discounts to the government meaning the prices are unlikely to really change and any upside will be eaten by the big bag holders selling directly to the government   As always the retailers and tax payers will be the liquidity for the already rich ones as they are the ones who hear the news the latest and are the slowest to react   Nothing good will come out of this meantime what Trump is doing with the tariffs will have immediate negative impact on everyone affected thus the market outside speculation is very bearish right now",7,1741040031.0,2025-03-03 22:13:51
1j2uo5g,GpPpbOaM,"You‚Äôre spot on about the companies using their reserves to position themselves. For better or worse, I think it was inevitable. Similar to the successful mom &amp; pop getting absorbed by a conglomerate, this blockchain tech was too good to go ignored. Now, we‚Äôre entering a sort of hybrid decentralization.   As much as I love the ideals of DeFi, supposedly ~94% of the population has never held crypto. No matter how much we shout, the retail adoption is relatively low. Meanwhile, Ripple Labs has been using those reserves to successfully position their blockchain to become the standard for global finance and Hedera‚Äôs partnered with the biggest public and private companies to establish their HashGraph as the highest standard for security now and against quantum.

Crypto.com:  47,999,792.63 @ $0.000008454 = $405.81   Coinbase:  14,727,345.29 @ $0.000013 = $191.46   Robinhood:  3,072,693 @ $0.0000185 = $56.84   ====================================   I guess that is $654.11 / 65,799,830.92 = $0.000009941 Average Cost  Thanks for making me do the math, so at least I know I'm currently not underwater across the board.
