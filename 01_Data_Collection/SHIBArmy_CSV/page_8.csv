1j16zgq,CAN-SUX-IT,Yes you’re right. Why would Ryoshi give 50% of SHIB to Buterin for absolutely no apparent reason? No sane person would do that right?,-10,1740857675.0,2025-03-01 19:34:35

1j16zgq,klobbenropper,"As I said, a huge number of ETH shitcoins used his wallet as a burn wallet for marketing purposes. Shiba was just the most successful one—by far. When the value suddenly soared into the billions, he had to act. And he did the only right thing: he transferred 90% to a proper burn wallet and donated the remaining 10% to a Covid fund. He is not the founder of Shiba. Period.",5,1740859155.0,2025-03-01 19:59:15

1j16zgq,CAN-SUX-IT,I don’t trust anyone with my bank account password. So why would I trust someone who could make a $100 million if he fooled everyone into believing that he made a crypto wallet that’s a dead end. He puts a bunch of crypto in there. Then others start putting crypto in it to so called burn it. Then a couple decades later he empties it and claims someone hacked it and stole everything.

1j16zgq,CAN-SUX-IT,"He was so intrigued that the first crypto was created by a mysterious entity that never came out. Satoshi was so fascinating to Buterin, so he created his own magical fantasy with Ryoshi’s concocted story. So when he created the second crypto he wanted to copy the magic that bitcoin had. So he created Shib and Ryoshi and injected himself as a wise and kind mentor that helped in the creation of Shib. He was given half of all Shib that he allegedly destroyed 45% of all Shib and gave away the remaining 5% to a charity. To me he created Shib while he was high. Realized he had made way too much and needed to correct his mistakes so he injected himself into this fantasy and the rest is his self made fantasy/history.",0,1740930629.0,2025-03-02 15:50:29

That’s when the second quarterly report of the orange grifters administration comes out and it’s going to show that we’re in a recession.

1iwrq4v,NihilistHUGZ,"Oh so investment advice from someone who sold years ago. Do you think people care about your insights when you only came back after making a 3233.33% profit to drag the asset, because it hasn't repeatedly undergone those appreciative cycles for others to experience the same profit as you? Your experience is relative and not relavent due to the reality of the growth cycle for this asset. Anyone holding for a quick bag has lost focus on what a viable asset is.  The focus for many is that this asset in particular started as a MEME and has grown to real world use case and adaptations which utilize the ecosystem. This has transitioned from something you experienced to now something we are experiencing.  You can dislike SHIB but in this phase of asset class growth and evolution, sentiments and your sentiment are an issue which degrades the value of this asset that others are invested in relative to their own experience. If you want to see SHIB fail then it will be because people like yourself keep coming back to scare current investors. Hypothetically but also realistically this is becoming a long term value asset.  As long as partnerships and integrations such as the recent UAE Energy Department utilization of the SHIB ecosystem continue there is no reason to doubt the long term viability and success for others to hold SHIB in their portfolio. Not everyone holds JUST SHIB btw. Some like myself are utilization driven investors who are capturing the cryptocurrencies tied to emerging sector utilizations in what I perceive to be the greatest evolution of the global economic structure since the Industrial Revolution.",2,1740502584.0,2025-02-25 16:56:24

1iwttu7,NihilistHUGZ,"Over the past few months I have learned a vast amount of the structure for bots or algorithmic trading. They are set to identify buy and sell signals based on metrics which track several different values lile rules. A human requires years of experience to recognize these same patterns but even then there is no competition for the algorithm that identifies those same patterns to the 'value' meaning higher frequency of potential trades.  One of the greatest challenges is the frequency of these trades and keeping up with them. They also work against each other as well as many people use them. So if someone improperly sets the rules for the algorithm the consequences affects the other bots and humans in a terrible cycle.  These algorithms are set by large investors and other companies pay for these service to do everything from provide liquidity/suck liquidity, false flag dumps, market aggregates, and many other ways to benefit and harm the process movements of EVERY ASSET CLASS NOT JUST CRYPTO.

We could get more burns by finding companies to utilize the Shibarium. I have a petition for just that. The more SHIB gets utilized for payment systems the fees can be burned off if they utilize the Shibarium and that can generate massive burns to create accelerated scarcity and value.

If you look at what I said then it is hypothetical but I have provided my math on this in the past and my idea is plausible and realistic.  Any discussion of the burns on the effect they have for price movements are currently irrelevant bc you are partially right. The only impactful burn was Vitalik.
