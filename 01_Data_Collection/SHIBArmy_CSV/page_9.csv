1ivjvsq,NihilistHUGZ,If you are down and you want to cut your losses then take the same amount you have or 1.5x the intial investment and find the lowest point of a dip during an upcycle and average down to reduce the overall loss.   Essentially you pay to not lose so much. Just wait for price to rise up over the 2nd investment and the gains will help stabilize your losses and then you can exit.   Its a trick i use on my losers bc I'm not perfect and I get into some situations but have learned how to turn a 20+% loss into a 4% loss or even flip to break even and sometimes end up with a smidgen of profit.   Just dont let losses cause you to capitulate to the point where you are purely emotional entering and exiting trades. Hone in on some TA and follow the charts until you can plot the entry and exit.  When you feel complacent or are looking at the asset with denial then it is time to take a step back and reasses your position.,1,1740258732.0,2025-02-22 21:12:12

1ivjvsq,NihilistHUGZ,I understand this issue. It happens and can feel like a burdensome investment when you find yourself in that situation.  Sometimes its just tied up and might require a long term assessment with a stop loss set to a max loss and then walk away with an alert set for when the price starts moving above milestones like  0.00002 0.00003  That may help give you more time to build captial while removing yourself from the situation for increments of time,1,1740268338.0,2025-02-22 23:52:18

1ivjvsq,AccomplishedTwist368,"It's not about what can happen with this investment alone. It's about opportunity cost and risk/reqard. What could that money earn you somewhere else?  Shib is a fairly safe investment, think store of value with some opportunity for fluctuations. If you want to make 2x-4x or whatever, it's very doable.  However, if you are seeking more of a conviction play to find a 1000x-10,000x potential, shib simply can't.    So if you pulled out your shib rn and then look a year from now to see it could have been 4x but you made 1200x on a different coin, are you going to be upset to took SHIB for a loss? Probably not.

Here are some companies that accept SHIB:  1. **Newegg** ‚Äì An online electronics retailer. 2. **Overstock** ‚Äì A popular online furniture and home goods store. 3. **AMC Theaters** ‚Äì A major movie theater chain in the U.S. has announced that it will accept SHIB for ticket and concession purchases. 4. **Travala** ‚Äì A travel booking site that accepts SHIB for hotel bookings, flights, and more. 5. **BitPay** ‚Äì A payment processor that facilitates SHIB payments for various merchants. 6. **Twitch** ‚Äì The popular streaming platform accepts SHIB as a payment method via partnerships with BitPay.  There are also smaller businesses and online merchants that accept SHIB, but it‚Äôs still growing in terms of widespread adoption. You can also use SHIB for purchases indirectly through payment processors like BitPay or Shopify merchants that enable cryptocurrency payments.",5,1740068044.0,2025-02-20 16:14:04

I do the analysis in voice to text and then go through and capitalize key terms. This repetition was my way of giving people a passenger seat as I drive through Indicators to teach how they are used.  TA is but 1 key aspect and a strong refined process can enable each of you to understand and make full sense of what you are seeing. This TA process is the FUD/FOMO killer. It was made specifically to track crypto and has been intimately refined for SHIB.  Looking ahead, I have plans to go through and do a refining process and may look for inputs to some of the planned improvements so be on the lookout.
