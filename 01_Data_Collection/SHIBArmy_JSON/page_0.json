          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nLooks like not much has changed in terms of market position other than ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô accumulating through the dip. Momentum Indicators reveal that the market has returned to Neutral ground with Buyers holding a strategic yet Weak level of control. Trend Indicators show that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, highlighting the Consolidation phase of the current market. Bollinger Bands reveal expansion; to me, this appears as a contraction phase that is ballooning to show a stronger breakout pressure underlying. ADX values signal Weak Trend strength, with the price AT the Supertrend level and working through Short term EMAs while remaining BELOW the 200-Day EMA. This reveals the market's attempt to revitalize ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô. Volatility Indicators signal Volatility falling to the LOW end of our norms range while price movements began rising through the Volatility Bands to place pressure against the HIGH Bands. This supports an outlook from the Bollinger Bands indicating growing breakout pressure.\n\nVolume Indicators show a Short term pause in participation during the Consolidation phase, while the CMF reveals an increasing rate at which ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô is taking positions and an increased level of money continuing to flow into the market compared to outflows from Sellers. Sentiment Indicators highlight ‚ÄòSmart Money's‚Äô Strong level of accumulation. This heightened level of Buy activity confirms the strength of our Support levels while preserving the Long term positive Trend cycle. News articles ramp up coverage of Bullish utilization by highlighting increasingly positive technical signals, huge price forecasts, and strategic ecosystem upgrades. Despite the Long term Support from the Utility narrative, articles offer fact-based insights into whale activity and potential Sell traps that they identify as areas of Short term Volatility. While still helping to alleviate FUD/FOMO, the articles are increasingly encouraging to investors and offer institutional insights.\n\nDynamics are converging while the market holds in a wait-and-see phase for clearer signals and confirmation from Volume. As the market absorbs the catalyst, we have some underlying cautious Sentiment that will only temper the return to the previous dynamic cycle. As we continue, it will be a little more restrained than our previous expectations, but nonetheless, we are just waiting for the market to catalyze ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô in an extended Consolidation phase.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is WITHIN the Neutral zone at the Long term Neutral major pivot point. Since this is an extended Consolidation phase, the Neutral zone extends from the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001270 down to our previous close price at $0.00001250. At MAX, the 1st Target will be to capture the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week LOW at $0.00001300. At LOWEST, the price will reach down and touch the Long term Support level at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001220.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they‚Äôre the most important to you in the world.\n\nThe petition still needs your help. Make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.\n\nPetition:\n\nhttps://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition",

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looks like not much has changed in terms of market position other than ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô accumulating through the dip. Momentum Indicators reveal that the market has returned to Neutral ground with Buyers holding a strategic yet Weak level of control. Trend Indicators show that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, highlighting the Consolidation phase of the current market. Bollinger Bands reveal expansion; to me, this appears as a contraction phase that is ballooning to show a stronger breakout pressure underlying. ADX values signal Weak Trend strength, with the price AT the Supertrend level and working through Short term EMAs while remaining BELOW the 200-Day EMA. This reveals the market&amp;#39;s attempt to revitalize ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô. Volatility Indicators signal Volatility falling to the LOW end of our norms range while price movements began rising through the Volatility Bands to place pressure against the HIGH Bands. This supports an outlook from the Bollinger Bands indicating growing breakout pressure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Volume Indicators show a Short term pause in participation during the Consolidation phase, while the CMF reveals an increasing rate at which ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô is taking positions and an increased level of money continuing to flow into the market compared to outflows from Sellers. Sentiment Indicators highlight ‚ÄòSmart Money&amp;#39;s‚Äô Strong level of accumulation. This heightened level of Buy activity confirms the strength of our Support levels while preserving the Long term positive Trend cycle. News articles ramp up coverage of Bullish utilization by highlighting increasingly positive technical signals, huge price forecasts, and strategic ecosystem upgrades. Despite the Long term Support from the Utility narrative, articles offer fact-based insights into whale activity and potential Sell traps that they identify as areas of Short term Volatility. While still helping to alleviate FUD/FOMO, the articles are increasingly encouraging to investors and offer institutional insights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dynamics are converging while the market holds in a wait-and-see phase for clearer signals and confirmation from Volume. As the market absorbs the catalyst, we have some underlying cautious Sentiment that will only temper the return to the previous dynamic cycle. As we continue, it will be a little more restrained than our previous expectations, but nonetheless, we are just waiting for the market to catalyze ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô in an extended Consolidation phase.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is WITHIN the Neutral zone at the Long term Neutral major pivot point. Since this is an extended Consolidation phase, the Neutral zone extends from the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001270 down to our previous close price at $0.00001250. At MAX, the 1st Target will be to capture the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week LOW at $0.00001300. At LOWEST, the price will reach down and touch the Long term Support level at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001220.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they‚Äôre the most important to you in the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The petition still needs your help. Make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Petition:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition\"&gt;https://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nI'm just going to come right out and say that I find pre-announcement Consolidations to be absolutely annoying, but I get it. While ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô waits for the outcome of the FOMC meeting, this high-impact catalyst has caused those traders to reduce their activity, leading to a period of LOW Volume before the market decisively begins moving again. Either way, today gives us insight into the market's sensitivity to event risks and external catalysts. Momentum Indicators reveal that, despite the pullback from Buyers, there was also less Seller activity. That means that the Buyers' reduced level of activity is still holding the market at about the same Neutral position as yesterday. Trend Indicators show that the price is BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud while placing pressure on the LOW Band, supporting a simple outlook of Consolidation. Bollinger Bands are contracting sharply, which highlights the buildup of breakout pressure. ADX values signal Average Trend strength with the price BELOW the Supertrend and all EMA levels, revealing a lack of ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Bands breakout signal with Volatility rising to the Neutral of our norms range. Prices recapturing ground WITHIN the Volatility Bands highlight Consolidation and Neutral Support.\n\nVolume Indicators signal a strategic level of participation that holds the market in a Neutral state while ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô continues to move more money into the market than Sellers are moving out. Sentiment Indicators reveal distribution, but it appears that ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô is combining Short term profit-taking to hold the market strategically at a Neutral level while they gauge the impact of the FOMC results. Despite this Short term event-driven Consolidation, the market remains in a Long term positive Trend cycle, as seen by the resilient, positive PVT value. News articles continue the Bullish Utility narrative with highlights of token burns, technical breakout signals, and ecosystem upgrades. Despite these positive Long term insights, they offer fact-based caution by covering the ‚ÄòSell Wall‚Äô, heavy Sell pressure, and Short term price struggles that help continue to counter FUD/FOMO while remaining optimistic about realistic challenges.\n\nI find event-based Consolidations irritating, but there remains an underlying excitement. In my mind there are only 2 scenarios. ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô already has an expectation and will not be surprised if there is no change and the result remains Neutral; in that case, we would continue in the ‚ÄòBreakout Initiation‚Äô phase. Alternatively, if the results are more positive than expected, an explosive amount of Momentum will occur in the market, and we would still continue the ‚ÄòBreakout Initiation‚Äô phase except with a turbo. I highly doubt any negative impact from the FOMC results, so I see this only going 1 of 2 ways. Now we sit back and wait; I hope you got the entry you wanted!\n\nLong term Support and Resistances indicate that the price has made its way INSIDE the Neutral zone, still BELOW the Short and Long term Neutral major pivot points. At LOWEST, the market will touch our Long term MAJOR Support level at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001220. I do not see us going any lower. At MAX, I can see us breaking into the ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô to test the 1st Target MAX at $0.00001330. The 2nd Target MAX will be the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001380. And just to be nice, the 3rd Target MAX will be $0.00001460.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they‚Äôre the most important to you in the world.\n\nThe petition still needs your help. Make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.\n\nPetition:\n\nhttps://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition",

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just going to come right out and say that I find pre-announcement Consolidations to be absolutely annoying, but I get it. While ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô waits for the outcome of the FOMC meeting, this high-impact catalyst has caused those traders to reduce their activity, leading to a period of LOW Volume before the market decisively begins moving again. Either way, today gives us insight into the market&amp;#39;s sensitivity to event risks and external catalysts. Momentum Indicators reveal that, despite the pullback from Buyers, there was also less Seller activity. That means that the Buyers&amp;#39; reduced level of activity is still holding the market at about the same Neutral position as yesterday. Trend Indicators show that the price is BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud while placing pressure on the LOW Band, supporting a simple outlook of Consolidation. Bollinger Bands are contracting sharply, which highlights the buildup of breakout pressure. ADX values signal Average Trend strength with the price BELOW the Supertrend and all EMA levels, revealing a lack of ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Bands breakout signal with Volatility rising to the Neutral of our norms range. Prices recapturing ground WITHIN the Volatility Bands highlight Consolidation and Neutral Support.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Volume Indicators signal a strategic level of participation that holds the market in a Neutral state while ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô continues to move more money into the market than Sellers are moving out. Sentiment Indicators reveal distribution, but it appears that ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô is combining Short term profit-taking to hold the market strategically at a Neutral level while they gauge the impact of the FOMC results. Despite this Short term event-driven Consolidation, the market remains in a Long term positive Trend cycle, as seen by the resilient, positive PVT value. News articles continue the Bullish Utility narrative with highlights of token burns, technical breakout signals, and ecosystem upgrades. Despite these positive Long term insights, they offer fact-based caution by covering the ‚ÄòSell Wall‚Äô, heavy Sell pressure, and Short term price struggles that help continue to counter FUD/FOMO while remaining optimistic about realistic challenges.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I find event-based Consolidations irritating, but there remains an underlying excitement. In my mind there are only 2 scenarios. ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô already has an expectation and will not be surprised if there is no change and the result remains Neutral; in that case, we would continue in the ‚ÄòBreakout Initiation‚Äô phase. Alternatively, if the results are more positive than expected, an explosive amount of Momentum will occur in the market, and we would still continue the ‚ÄòBreakout Initiation‚Äô phase except with a turbo. I highly doubt any negative impact from the FOMC results, so I see this only going 1 of 2 ways. Now we sit back and wait; I hope you got the entry you wanted!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price has made its way INSIDE the Neutral zone, still BELOW the Short and Long term Neutral major pivot points. At LOWEST, the market will touch our Long term MAJOR Support level at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001220. I do not see us going any lower. At MAX, I can see us breaking into the ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô to test the 1st Target MAX at $0.00001330. The 2nd Target MAX will be the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001380. And just to be nice, the 3rd Target MAX will be $0.00001460.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support.

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nBuyers are ramping up pressure against the ‚ÄòSell Wall‚Äô in an attempt to revitalize ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô and smooth the market into the next dynamic phase cycle. Momentum Indicators show that Buyers are strategically increasing pressure at a stable pace while steering the market to Neutral ground and leaving Sellers with Weak control. Trend Indicators signal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, which seems to highlight that the ‚ÄòBear Trap‚Äô phase is coming to an end and that a Bullish Consolidation cycle is active. Bollinger Bands show expansion, which is an early sign of Consolidation in conjunction with the insight of the price‚Äôs position WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud. ADX values reveal Strong Bullish Trend strength with the price BELOW the Supertrend and recapturing the Short term EMA levels while still attempting to reach our 200-Day EMA to revitalize ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Bands expansion, with Volatility remaining at the LOW/NEUTRAL of our norms range. Price movements are recapturing ground WITHIN the Volatility Bands, supporting the current Bullish Consolidation phase.\n\nVolume Indicators highlight the surging participation we were looking for, which is indicative of the beginning of our ‚ÄòBreakout Initiation‚Äô phase. Despite seeing Sellers with Weak control of the market, ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô is now beginning to move more money into the market than Sellers can move out. Sentiment Indicators support this with signs of Strong levels of accumulation that are greater than the distribution from the ‚ÄòSell Wall‚Äô. Also, the CCI confirms the Neutral ground I was referring to. PVT values indicate that ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô has strengthened the Long term positive Trend cycle and that we may be on the cusp of a major breakout soon. News articles have shifted their focus from the Short term struggles to highlight the Long term Bullish Utility narrative further, but they are tempered with reports that continue highlighting the significant Sell pressure from Weak activity and the sheer size of the ‚ÄòSell Wall‚Äô. These cautions are fact-based and help alleviate FUD/FOMO, while still allowing us to see Strong positive signals for growth from token burns, promising technical signals, and Shibarium developments. They continue to signal Long term institutional support and awareness too.\n\nI expect things to continue following the identified dynamics we have been able to support with technicals and fundamentals . This appears to be the last of the ‚ÄòShake‚Äô and the more welcoming side of Consolidation, where we begin Uptrending at a stable pace as seen by the Average True Range retaining such a LOW value. This phase, which we have observed over the past couple of days, is what I would characterize as an accumulation area where ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô is able to find enough Sellers to build what I use in my own methodologies as an ‚ÄòAntifragile‚Äô position. This is a wise move because, when you think about it, they are able to absorb the ‚ÄòSell Wall‚Äô while also converging a technical structure with a liquidity dynamic. Just look at the ‚ÄòBear Trap‚Äô that was set recently that led to the position we are at now. I would not say that it is manipulation, but it is a consistent strategic position that is also creating a cushion for the market moving forward, as their position creates a hedge against any market shocks that we could experience from external catalysts. My advice is to be patient, get ready, and follow the dynamics because the ‚ÄòBreakout Initiation‚Äô phase is about to begin soon.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is resting AT the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW, which is acting as our current very Short term (NOW) Neutral major pivot point. Thinking about it in increasing time frames, the next Neutral major pivot point to capture would be the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week LOW at $0.00001300. The market wants to return to the Long term Neutral zone, which is all the way up near the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001350. That is just the Neutral ground breakdown. At MAX, the market will attempt to reach its 1st Target after the Neutral zone at the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001380. Let us focus only on the 1st Targets because that is where the market is at. The LOWEST point is our 1st and ONLY LOW Target, and it aligns with the Long term MAJOR Support at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001220. A fall BELOW that level would constitute a CRITICAL decline.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they‚Äôre the most important to you in the world.\n\nThe petition still needs your help.

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Buyers are ramping up pressure against the ‚ÄòSell Wall‚Äô in an attempt to revitalize ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô and smooth the market into the next dynamic phase cycle. Momentum Indicators show that Buyers are strategically increasing pressure at a stable pace while steering the market to Neutral ground and leaving Sellers with Weak control. Trend Indicators signal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, which seems to highlight that the ‚ÄòBear Trap‚Äô phase is coming to an end and that a Bullish Consolidation cycle is active. Bollinger Bands show expansion, which is an early sign of Consolidation in conjunction with the insight of the price‚Äôs position WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud. ADX values reveal Strong Bullish Trend strength with the price BELOW the Supertrend and recapturing the Short term EMA levels while still attempting to reach our 200-Day EMA to revitalize ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Bands expansion, with Volatility remaining at the LOW/NEUTRAL of our norms range. Price movements are recapturing ground WITHIN the Volatility Bands, supporting the current Bullish Consolidation phase.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Volume Indicators highlight the surging participation we were looking for, which is indicative of the beginning of our ‚ÄòBreakout Initiation‚Äô phase. Despite seeing Sellers with Weak control of the market, ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô is now beginning to move more money into the market than Sellers can move out. Sentiment Indicators support this with signs of Strong levels of accumulation that are greater than the distribution from the ‚ÄòSell Wall‚Äô. Also, the CCI confirms the Neutral ground I was referring to. PVT values indicate that ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô has strengthened the Long term positive Trend cycle and that we may be on the cusp of a major breakout soon. News articles have shifted their focus from the Short term struggles to highlight the Long term Bullish Utility narrative further, but they are tempered with reports that continue highlighting the significant Sell pressure from Weak activity and the sheer size of the ‚ÄòSell Wall‚Äô. These cautions are fact-based and help alleviate FUD/FOMO, while still allowing us to see Strong positive signals for growth from token burns, promising technical signals, and Shibarium developments. They continue to signal Long term institutional support and awareness too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I expect things to continue following the identified dynamics we have been able to support with technicals and fundamentals . This appears to be the last of the ‚ÄòShake‚Äô and the more welcoming side of Consolidation, where we begin Uptrending at a stable pace as seen by the Average True Range retaining such a LOW value. This phase, which we have observed over the past couple of days, is what I would characterize as an accumulation area where ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô is able to find enough Sellers to build what I use in my own methodologies as an ‚ÄòAntifragile‚Äô position. This is a wise move because, when you think about it, they are able to absorb the ‚ÄòSell Wall‚Äô while also converging a technical structure with a liquidity dynamic. Just look at the ‚ÄòBear Trap‚Äô that was set recently that led to the position we are at now. I would not say that it is manipulation, but it is a consistent strategic position that is also creating a cushion for the market moving forward, as their position creates a hedge against any market shocks that we could experience from external catalysts. My advice is to be patient, get ready, and follow the dynamics because the ‚ÄòBreakout Initiation‚Äô phase is about to begin soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is resting AT the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW, which is acting as our current very Short term (NOW) Neutral major pivot point. Thinking about it in increasing time frames, the next Neutral major pivot point to capture would be the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week LOW at $0.00001300. The market wants to return to the Long term Neutral zone, which is all the way up near the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001350. That is just the Neutral ground breakdown. At MAX, the market will attempt to reach its 1st Target after the Neutral zone at the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001380. Let us focus only on the 1st Targets because that is where the market is at. The LOWEST point is our 1st and ONLY LOW Target, and it aligns with the Long term MAJOR Support at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001220. A fall BELOW that level would constitute a CRITICAL decline.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they‚Äôre the most important to you in the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The petition still needs your help. Make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Petition:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition\"&gt;https://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\n‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô has Sellers hitting the floor price in a tight Consolidation phase where we have a narrow micro Support and Resistance range serving as an accumulation area and continuing to set the stage for a breakout. Momentum Indicators reveal Buyers moving with caution against the remaining ‚ÄòSell Wall‚Äô, as it has the potential to shake out Weak conviction whales. Currently, this cautious exchange holds just ABOVE Oversold levels, with Sellers maintaining a sustained Weak level of control over the market. Trend Indicators show that the price is BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, signaling Bearish Consolidation. Bollinger Bands are in a contraction that is expanding; I won't call it an expansion, just a growing contraction phase that holds a resilient breakout signal. ADX values show elevated yet Average Trend strength holding the price BELOW the Supertrend and all EMAs, revealing a lack of ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô in the current market. Volatility Indicators continue to support the Bollinger Bands breakout signal, as Volatility has fallen deeper into the LOW end of our norms range. Volatility Bands are tightening as the price attempts to Consolidate within their Support channels, confirming a Bearish Consolidation phase.\n\nVolume Indicators continue to show increased participation, yet in the Short term we can see a cautious pause, which may be our calm before the storm. The ‚ÄòSell Wall‚Äô continues to move more money out of the market than ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô is accumulating. Sentiment Indicators reveal an institutional level of caution for the current market, where we still maintain Strong levels of distribution, though at drastically reduced levels. This Short term strength has been able to sustain the Short term negative Trend cycle but was unable to strengthen it any further, as seen by the PVT holding a Strong positive value which indicates the resiliency of the Long term positive Trend cycle. News articles continue the Utility narrative with Strong signals of utilization from Shibarium transactions and the potential catalyst from influencers, which continue to highlight our evolution while helping to counter FUD/FOMO. Coverage of widespread dumping and the heavy Sell pressure from different groups helps remind investors of the Short term challenges that remain.\n\nIt looks like not much has changed as far as a Consolidation phase running sideways, which I must admit is boring rather than alarming, personally. This cautious pause from ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô is not random but still part of a well-defined structure. Though we don't see it, ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô is still accumulating quietly, and we are simply waiting for an intraday breakout in the Volume Indicators. Now it's just waiting through a packed, DMV waiting room style Consolidation phase that is going to take some discipline. Just to suggest some stability: if you're scared of the breakout failing, then set a stop-loss at 1 ATR movement (or roughly $0.00000012) below the current Supports. That way you respect discipline and remove the emotional bias of your untrained eyes perceiving a Downtrend, so you gain conviction and don't get shaken out.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is resting AT a Short term market BOTTOM at the 50% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001270. At LOWEST, our Short and Long term align to show that the true CRITICAL BOTTOM is at the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW at $0.00001220. At MAX, the price is going to recapture the Neutral major pivot point at the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001330. 2nd Target MAX will be to test the ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô for directional bias at the 38.2% retracement of the 13‚ÄëWeek LOW at $0.00001370.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life.

Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô has Sellers hitting the floor price in a tight Consolidation phase where we have a narrow micro Support and Resistance range serving as an accumulation area and continuing to set the stage for a breakout. Momentum Indicators reveal Buyers moving with caution against the remaining ‚ÄòSell Wall‚Äô, as it has the potential to shake out Weak conviction whales. Currently, this cautious exchange holds just ABOVE Oversold levels, with Sellers maintaining a sustained Weak level of control over the market. Trend Indicators show that the price is BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, signaling Bearish Consolidation. Bollinger Bands are in a contraction that is expanding; I won&amp;#39;t call it an expansion, just a growing contraction phase that holds a resilient breakout signal. ADX values show elevated yet Average Trend strength holding the price BELOW the Supertrend and all EMAs, revealing a lack of ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô in the current market. Volatility Indicators continue to support the Bollinger Bands breakout signal, as Volatility has fallen deeper into the LOW end of our norms range. Volatility Bands are tightening as the price attempts to Consolidate within their Support channels, confirming a Bearish Consolidation phase.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Volume Indicators continue to show increased participation, yet in the Short term we can see a cautious pause, which may be our calm before the storm. The ‚ÄòSell Wall‚Äô continues to move more money out of the market than ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô is accumulating. Sentiment Indicators reveal an institutional level of caution for the current market, where we still maintain Strong levels of distribution, though at drastically reduced levels. This Short term strength has been able to sustain the Short term negative Trend cycle but was unable to strengthen it any further, as seen by the PVT holding a Strong positive value which indicates the resiliency of the Long term positive Trend cycle. News articles continue the Utility narrative with Strong signals of utilization from Shibarium transactions and the potential catalyst from influencers, which continue to highlight our evolution while helping to counter FUD/FOMO. Coverage of widespread dumping and the heavy Sell pressure from different groups helps remind investors of the Short term challenges that remain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It looks like not much has changed as far as a Consolidation phase running sideways, which I must admit is boring rather than alarming, personally.

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nThis is really amazing to see such a pure dynamic playing out, where currently the price is testing the remaining market and allowing ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô to determine if it‚Äôs time to start the next phase. This is a beautiful ‚ÄòBear Trap‚Äô! Momentum Indicators show the last bit of squeeze pressing into Oversold territory, where Sellers have taken Weak control over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators signal that the price is BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, which confirms the Bearish Consolidation; yet when you look at the Bollinger Bands contracting by a value of 1, it implies that the ‚ÄòBear Trap‚Äô is firmly set and breakout pressure is sustaining confirmation. ADX values show stronger yet Average Trend strength with the price BELOW the Supertrend and all EMAs, meaning the market is moving sideways with underlying stability and without ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô. Volatility Indicators reveal that Volatility remains at the LOW end of our norms range while prices stay BELOW the LOW Volatility Bands. This confirms the Bearish Consolidation and supports the Bollinger Bands signal for building breakout pressure, as the price will look to return WITHIN those Bands of Support and Resistance.\n\nVolume Indicators finally show a massive spike in Short term participation where Sellers pulled the market into the bottom of the wave cycle, which is part of the accumulation dynamic. This, combined with some profit-taking from ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô, helped support the squeeze and began moving more money out of the market than in. Sentiment Indicators highlight this strategic effort from ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô, combining with the last of the squeezed Sellers. Strong distribution levels, rapidly accelerating into Oversold territory, marking the height of a Short term negative Trend cycle; yet behind all the strategic participation is our Long term positive Trend cycle, which is strengthening as seen by the PVT value sharply increasing. News articles have ramped up the Bullish Utility narrative by highlighting impressive technical signals, massive token burn efforts, and the new SHIB Pay. These continue to build investor confidence and counter FUD/FOMO. Their cautions offer mixed market signals by showing some Bearish technical Trends and competition from emerging coins, which helps remind us of the realistic challenges that still lie ahead.\n\nMost will see this as a Downtrend, and it technically is. However, the way I view the charts is that this is the beginning of a new Uptrend. It strategically traps some of the late Sellers and Bears while testing the supply. This was the LOW Volume test of the ‚ÄòShakeout‚Äô, and from here I expect the Consolidation to run its course so we can gear up to begin an Uptrend cycle that will test the Resistance boundaries.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is holding WITHIN the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô at the 2nd-level Support pivot point. The market really wanted to bounce off that 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/HIGH at $0.00001270, and it was a great position to set the ‚ÄòBear Trap‚Äô without needing to respect the Long term Support level at $0.00001220, which coincides with the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW. This is the LOWEST point for the current Trend cycle. At MAX, the price is going to start retracing, and we will follow a path based on the next 3 Targets. 1st Target MAX will be to recapture the Short term Neutral major pivot point at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001330. 2nd Target MAX will be to reach the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week LOW at $0.00001370. 3rd Target MAX will be to reach the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001470.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they‚Äôre the most important to you in the world.\n\nThe petition still needs your help.

Trend Indicators signal that the price is BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, which confirms the Bearish Consolidation; yet when you look at the Bollinger Bands contracting by a value of 1, it implies that the ‚ÄòBear Trap‚Äô is firmly set and breakout pressure is sustaining confirmation. ADX values show stronger yet Average Trend strength with the price BELOW the Supertrend and all EMAs, meaning the market is moving sideways with underlying stability and without ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô. Volatility Indicators reveal that Volatility remains at the LOW end of our norms range while prices stay BELOW the LOW Volatility Bands. This confirms the Bearish Consolidation and supports the Bollinger Bands signal for building breakout pressure, as the price will look to return WITHIN those Bands of Support and Resistance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Volume Indicators finally show a massive spike in Short term participation where Sellers pulled the market into the bottom of the wave cycle, which is part of the accumulation dynamic. This, combined with some profit-taking from ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô, helped support the squeeze and began moving more money out of the market than in. Sentiment Indicators highlight this strategic effort from ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô, combining with the last of the squeezed Sellers. Strong distribution levels, rapidly accelerating into Oversold territory, marking the height of a Short term negative Trend cycle; yet behind all the strategic participation is our Long term positive Trend cycle, which is strengthening as seen by the PVT value sharply increasing. News articles have ramped up the Bullish Utility narrative by highlighting impressive technical signals, massive token burn efforts, and the new SHIB Pay. These continue to build investor confidence and counter FUD/FOMO. Their cautions offer mixed market signals by showing some Bearish technical Trends and competition from emerging coins, which helps remind us of the realistic challenges that still lie ahead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most will see this as a Downtrend, and it technically is. However, the way I view the charts is that this is the beginning of a new Uptrend. It strategically traps some of the late Sellers and Bears while testing the supply. This was the LOW Volume test of the ‚ÄòShakeout‚Äô, and from here I expect the Consolidation to run its course so we can gear up to begin an Uptrend cycle that will test the Resistance boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is holding WITHIN the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô at the 2nd-level Support pivot point. The market really wanted to bounce off that 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/HIGH at $0.00001270, and it was a great position to set the ‚ÄòBear Trap‚Äô without needing to respect the Long term Support level at $0.00001220, which coincides with the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW. This is the LOWEST point for the current Trend cycle. At MAX, the price is going to start retracing, and we will follow a path based on the next 3 Targets. 1st Target MAX will be to recapture the Short term Neutral major pivot point at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001330. 2nd Target MAX will be to reach the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week LOW at $0.00001370. 3rd Target MAX will be to reach the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001470.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they‚Äôre the most important to you in the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The petition still needs your help.

Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nWe are following proper market structure and respecting the price dynamics that we have identified over the past couple of days, which point to the formation of a ‚ÄòBreakout Initiation‚Äô phase. Momentum Indicators show that Buyers are sustaining a stable level of pressure against rising levels of profit-taking, nearly completing the full cycle needed to begin the next phase, despite holding only Weak control of the market over multiple time frames. Trend indicators reveal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, confirming a Consolidation phase. Bollinger Bands are contracting sharply, which is an early signal for breakout pressure. ADX values show Average Trend strength, with the price ABOVE the Supertrend and AT the EMA levels across both Long and Short term time frames, meaning the market is attempting to revitalize ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Band contraction, with Volatility falling to the LOW end of our norms range. Price movements remain WITHIN the Volatility Bands, supporting both the breakout and Consolidation signals.\n\nVolume Indicators highlight Weak levels of participation, which is encouraging since it reveals fewer Sellers in the market. Buyers, in spite of their Weak control, are continuing to move more money into the market than is being moved out. Sentiment Indicators show the last bit of distribution from Sellers, but this was only enough to counter the Short term Trend and smooth it back to a Neutral Trend cycle. Overall, ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô has continued to add Bullish pressure and increase the strength of the Long term positive Trend cycle, as evidenced by the increased PVT value. News articles continue supporting the Utility narrative with Bullish coverage of substantial token burns, technical signals for breakouts, and utility developments like SHIB pay. These articles build the case for incoming HIGHS while also offering fact-based perspectives about the significant ‚ÄòSell Wall‚Äô resistance. These cautions help to counter FUD/FOMO and keep investor expectations based on realistic market challenges.\n\nI feel like I put together a pretty compelling analysis for the potential for the rest of the month, so I do anticipate continuing to see the market dynamics unfold into the ‚ÄòBreakout Initiation‚Äô phase. We might run sideways here and there, but overall Bullish Consolidation should pick up and soon we will start an Uptrend cycle.\n\nLong term Support and Resistance signal that the price is resting AT the Neutral zone at the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001350. As investors begin accumulating through this Neutral range, I do not see us going much lower than a test of the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001330. At LOWEST, if we experience a stronger pullback than expected, the Target would be the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001270. At MAX, the price will rise ABOVE the Neutral zone and break through the ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô up to the 50% retracement of our 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001470.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life.

In the past, it is apparent to me now that I didn‚Äôt cover the breadth of potential for the market so I will lay out my thesis and make a case for multiple scenarios based on my personal methodology so maybe we can get some more accuracy in comparison to the SHIB analysis process I use to teach you all.\n\n\n\nThe 1st thing we will do is look at the chart over multiple time frames to establish some basics.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u00kwmhjiaye1.png?width=2081&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8529e22fa52b658eaa66125918d604b4124c3dc3\n\n\n\nHere we are pulled out over the lifespan. This takes each candle as 1 day. In this view we can start to see our defined level of Support at $0.00001220. Next observation is to notice the previous phases and cycles being established within the price line. As well we can determine the chart pattern and also the candlestick patterns that developed and how the market dynamics played out.\n\n\n\nNow we need to look at more of the current section of the Long term timeframe\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xvhmvfwliaye1.png?width=2081&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=475563c11e7e11329082bdd996af7981b3fd7dd9\n\n\n\n1. 1st main cycle with dynamics is right around March 2023 and we got Credit Suisse, USD weakness. This follows dynamics until we get into the area I have in red.¬†\n\n\n\n(RED) May 2023 we got US debt ceiling, and then China turns Bearish from June - July 2023. UST curve begins flattening out August 2023. Israel/Gaza in October 2023.\n\n\n\n1. Now we get to 2nd main cycle with dynamics and this aligns with FED moves from November 2023 through February 2024\n\n\n\nSo now we see how the external factors begin to shape the cluster and that we can verify the cycles will follow dynamics\n\n\n\nLets get even closer on the Long term\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hrt42qpniaye1.png?width=2081&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be3a9e94839e93dc55c823715297ef62870cdfdc\n\n\n\nBy using our previous Full cycle we can establish Fibonacci levels to understand some of what happened and what to expect as we move through different regions For starters the market experienced a full retracement cycle to 100% so that is the period where we get\n\n\\-Japan March 2024- through May 2024\n\n\\-France Election June 2024\n\n\\-Equity Rout July 2024\n\n\\-FED August 2024 through September 2024\n\n\\-China Eases a bit in October 2024\n\n\\-US Elections November 2024\n\n\\-China continues easing up through December 2024\n\n\\-US Tariffs January 2025 through April 2025\n\n\n\nWe now connect the external factors to further validate the market structure. A full retracement is an immediately bad experience‚Ä¶sure. BUT it implies a level of reversal where Sell pressure is at the weakest strength. Look what we now have aligning. The 100% retracement level, the long term level of Support at $0.00001220, and price movements respecting these boundaries.\n\n\n\nNow we need to get a look at a Short timeframe to begin to see the current market structure in a more volatile (more time per candle) price line\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dbwuylqpiaye1.png?width=2081&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=985977f7c70ac7a98956d1084639821c0223d775\n\n\n\nNow that we are in the 4 hour timeframe, right off the bat, I can see an Elliott wave cycle following the most immediate trend cycle following our current timeframe. After a market completes a full Elliott wave cycle we are in a new trend. Looks like we have to get closer to the current time frame\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3y4461nwiaye1.png?width=2081&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24b812685c91b1e3b7dccfc811eac8a67107336e\n\n\n\nShort time frames show that the current trend is experiencing higher HIGHS and higher LOWS after respecting the Long term Support zone. Let‚Äôs get closer\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qqcx72kyiaye1.png?width=2081&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0380eb9d5bec019393e79295fd97a1d8f9b1a8f8\n\n  \n\n\nTo start I know a new phase is a base building phase and that can be tedious so we look for the next phase and we follow the Trend to our past few days out and we see 2 distinct areas that show equilibrium between the top wick off the candle and the bottom wick. This is interesting because the length of this matching pressure doesn‚Äôt fit what looked like what would be a double top. This implies ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô and there are specific dynamics for that.\n\n\n\nIs this price line going up? Down? Sideways?\n\n\n\nIt starts up, then comes down and then we get accumulation while running sideways and the price takes a smooth turn down rather then sharp. Next we get a quick ramp in Buyers which is shown on the candle as a bottom wick growing from the candle. This happened and then a sharp downturn. That‚Äôs a shake off, there is accumulation and consolidation and now a new trend starts to develop.\n\n\n\nNow we have an idea that we are declining, there is accumulation and consolidation‚Ä¶ this is a Shakeout phase and we now know where we are in this new cycle. Let‚Äôs go hit the indicators to support our positioning. For this kind of validation we need Volume support to show an increase in participation.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ax3tcjt0jaye1.png?width=2081&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3959f259e3dfbdb588d3a93f08e1f0ef0ceaa2e5\n\n\n\nOver a Long term view we have confirmation of the New phase and also the Shakeout phase all the way through to the new Breakout Initiation Phase. AND that means just like it sounds. Where? Near the 100% Fibonacci‚Ä¶reversal‚Ä¶remember. Also, we validate Long term Support levels and this allows us to move on to our on DD for intrinsic value based on the ecosystem and yada yada whatever you‚Äôre in it for basically and to see your margin of safety level.\n\n\n\nA Breakout Initiation is followed by a Markup (Uptrend) phase. Again it is what it sounds like. Now we know we got to setup some tools to get a standard idea of the future.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/80y52ds2jaye1.png?width=1664&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e26408329c2310b1d3e770b20c290f8061ef1bc2\n\n\n\nHere we apply our Trend lines and micro Fibonacci where we see a convergence of expected Resistance lying at the $0.00002330 to $0.00002090.\n\n\n\nMy estimate for this is to use ATR to determine the extreme move for the current Breakout Initiation phase\n\n\n\n$0.00000091 x 3 = $0.00000273 that constitutes an extreme move potential\n\n\n\n$0.00001360 + $0.00000273 = $0.00001633. 1st Support Target\n\n\n\nThen transition to Markup phase gets another ATR extreme move = $0.00001906 2nd Support Target\n\n\n\nMarkup Phase gets another extreme ATR move = $0.00002179 3rd Target Support\n\n\n\nWe now have justified a price range from $0.00001633 to $0.00002179 from Now until the END OF JUNE.\n\n\n\nLowest Potential is to reach back down to the Long Term Support level at $0.00001220.\n\n\n\nThis is tedious to make into a tutorial/thesis style analysis but I am glad that it was requested because this was fun either way.\n\n\n\nHope this helps you all begin to see the current potential through my eyes and how I apply my other methodologies in a very generalized way to show you all a price projection!

In the past, it is apparent to me now that I didn‚Äôt cover the breadth of potential for the market so I will lay out my thesis and make a case for multiple scenarios based on my personal methodology so maybe we can get some more accuracy in comparison to the SHIB analysis process I use to teach you all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 1st thing we will do is look at the chart over multiple time frames to establish some basics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/u00kwmhjiaye1.png?width=2081&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8529e22fa52b658eaa66125918d604b4124c3dc3\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/u00kwmhjiaye1.png?width=2081&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8529e22fa52b658eaa66125918d604b4124c3dc3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here we are pulled out over the lifespan. This takes each candle as 1 day. In this view we can start to see our defined level of Support at $0.00001220. Next observation is to notice the previous phases and cycles being established within the price line. As well we can determine the chart pattern and also the candlestick patterns that developed and how the market dynamics played out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now we need to look at more of the current section of the Long term timeframe&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xvhmvfwliaye1.png?width=2081&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=475563c11e7e11329082bdd996af7981b3fd7dd9\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/xvhmvfwliaye1.png?width=2081&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=475563c11e7e11329082bdd996af7981b3fd7dd9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1st main cycle with dynamics is right around March 2023 and we got Credit Suisse, USD weakness. This follows dynamics until we get into the area I have in red.¬†&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(RED) May 2023 we got US debt ceiling, and then China turns Bearish from June - July 2023. UST curve begins flattening out August 2023. Israel/Gaza in October 2023.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Now we get to 2nd main cycle with dynamics and this aligns with FED moves from November 2023 through February 2024&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now we see how the external factors begin to shape the cluster and that we can verify the cycles will follow dynamics&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lets get even closer on the Long term&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hrt42qpniaye1.png?width=2081&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=be3a9e94839e93dc55c823715297ef62870cdfdc\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/hrt42qpniaye1.png?width=2081&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=be3a9e94839e93dc55c823715297ef62870cdfdc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By using our previous Full cycle we can establish Fibonacci levels to understand some of what happened and what to expect as we move through different regions For starters the market experienced a full retracement cycle to 100% so that is the period where we get&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Japan March 2024- through May 2024&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-France Election June 2024&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Equity Rout July 2024&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-FED August 2024 through September 2024&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-China Eases a bit in October 2024&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-US Elections November 2024&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-China continues easing up through December 2024&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-US Tariffs January 2025 through April 2025&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We now connect the external factors to further validate the market structure. A full retracement is an immediately bad experience‚Ä¶sure. BUT it implies a level of reversal where Sell pressure is at the weakest strength. Look what we now have aligning. The 100% retracement level, the long term level of Support at $0.00001220, and price movements respecting these boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now we need to get a look at a Short timeframe to begin to see the current market structure in a more volatile (more time per candle) price line&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/dbwuylqpiaye1.png?width=2081&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=985977f7c70ac7a98956d1084639821c0223d775\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/dbwuylqpiaye1.png?width=2081&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=985977f7c70ac7a98956d1084639821c0223d775&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that we are in the 4 hour timeframe, right off the bat, I can see an Elliott wave cycle following the most immediate trend cycle following our current timeframe. After a market completes a full Elliott wave cycle we are in a new trend. Looks like we have to get closer to the current time frame&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3y4461nwiaye1.png?width=2081&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=24b812685c91b1e3b7dccfc811eac8a67107336e\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/3y4461nwiaye1.png?width=2081&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=24b812685c91b1e3b7dccfc811eac8a67107336e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Short time frames show that the current trend is experiencing higher HIGHS and higher LOWS after respecting the Long term Support zone. Let‚Äôs get closer&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qqcx72kyiaye1.png?width=2081&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0380eb9d5bec019393e79295fd97a1d8f9b1a8f8\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/qqcx72kyiaye1.png?width=2081&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0380eb9d5bec019393e79295fd97a1d8f9b1a8f8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To start I know a new phase is a base building phase and that can be tedious so we look for the next phase and we follow the Trend to our past few days out and we see 2 distinct areas that show equilibrium between the top wick off the candle and the bottom wick. This is interesting because the length of this matching pressure doesn‚Äôt fit what looked like what would be a double top. This implies ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô and there are specific dynamics for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is this price line going up? Down? Sideways?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It starts up, then comes down and then we get accumulation while running sideways and the price takes a smooth turn down rather then sharp. Next we get a quick ramp in Buyers which is shown on the candle as a bottom wick growing from the candle. This happened and then a sharp downturn. That‚Äôs a shake off, there is accumulation and consolidation and now a new trend starts to develop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now we have an idea that we are declining, there is accumulation and consolidation‚Ä¶ this is a Shakeout phase and we now know where we are in this new cycle. Let‚Äôs go hit the indicators to support our positioning. For this kind of validation we need Volume support to show an increase in participation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ax3tcjt0jaye1.png?width=2081&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3959f259e3dfbdb588d3a93f08e1f0ef0ceaa2e5\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/ax3tcjt0jaye1.png?width=2081&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3959f259e3dfbdb588d3a93f08e1f0ef0ceaa2e5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over a Long term view we have confirmation of the New phase and also the Shakeout phase all the way through to the new Breakout Initiation Phase. AND that means just like it sounds. Where? Near the 100% Fibonacci‚Ä¶reversal‚Ä¶remember. Also, we validate Long term Support levels and this allows us to move on to our on DD for intrinsic value based on the ecosystem and yada yada whatever you‚Äôre in it for basically and to see your margin of safety level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A Breakout Initiation is followed by a Markup (Uptrend) phase. Again it is what it sounds like. Now we know we got to setup some tools to get a standard idea of the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/80y52ds2jaye1.png?width=1664&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e26408329c2310b1d3e770b20c290f8061ef1bc2\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/80y52ds2jaye1.png?width=1664&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e26408329c2310b1d3e770b20c290f8061ef1bc2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here we apply our Trend lines and micro Fibonacci where we see a convergence of expected Resistance lying at the $0.00002330 to $0.00002090.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My estimate for this is to use ATR to determine the extreme move for the current Breakout Initiation phase&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$0.00000091 x 3 = $0.00000273 that constitutes an extreme move potential&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$0.00001360 + $0.00000273 = $0.00001633. 1st Support Target&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then transition to Markup phase gets another ATR extreme move = $0.00001906 2nd Support Target&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Markup Phase gets another extreme ATR move = $0.00002179 3rd Target Support&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We now have justified a price range from $0.00001633 to $0.00002179 from Now until the END OF JUNE.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lowest Potential is to reach back down to the Long Term Support level at $0.00001220.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is tedious to make into a tutorial/thesis style analysis but I am glad that it was requested because this was fun either way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps you all begin to see the current potential through my eyes and how I apply my other methodologies in a very generalized way to show you all a price projection! ENJOY!  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nLooking at these charts feels like watching the final pieces of a puzzle fall into place. Momentum Indicators show ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô increasing the pressure on Seller positions to shake out the last of the Weak conviction profit-taking. This rapid pressure across multiple time frames has led to those few remaining Sellers exercising very Weak control over the market. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is rising WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, confirming a Bullish Consolidation and Uptrend cycle. Bollinger Bands are following that small incremental movement, which is a characteristic dynamic of the market that indicates Consolidation, while underlying this is a ballooning breakout pressure building. ADX values seem to have captured the very beginning of the Uptrend, moving with Average Trend strength and holding the price ABOVE the Superrend and all EMAs to confirm an active level of renewed ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô. Volatility Indicators continue to support the Bollinger Bands breakout signal, with Volatility holding firm in the Neutral of our norms range. Prices are confirming the Uptrend cycle by elevating through the Volatility Bands and rising ABOVE the HIGH Bands. This further highlights the Bullish Consolidation phase leading into a breakout cycle.\n\nVolume Indicators are confirming the profit-taking, as the reduced level of participation reflects the exit of those Short Sellers, while Long term participation remains stable to show ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô. Despite these matching levels of participation, ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô is strategically moving more money into the market than Sellers are moving out.  Sentiment Indicators highlight the Strong accumulation phase that ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô has sustained, which has now begun entering its Neutral cycle. This emerging positive Trend cycle will add accelerated strength to the Long term positive Trend if sustained over multiple time frames. News articles have seemingly killed the MEME narrative and are specifically highlighting the Utility aspects of Shiba Inu. Articles emphasizing the size of token burns, technical signals that support incoming highs, and admiration for strategic developments like the Shibarium integration all use positive fact-based coverage to highlight the Resistances and Volumes. This Bullish Long term narrative continues to counter FUD/FOMO while reminding investors of both the potentials and the challenges ahead.\n\nI follow my own methodologies, and based on how I see and assess market dynamics, everything is beginning to be characteristic of the expected next phase: ‚ÄòBreakout Initiation‚Äô. Usually, the breakout marks a transition where balance shifts from accumulation to a clear Uptrend. In the Short term, we will need to validate the breakout to rule out a one-off spike, but my expectation is that this follows the dynamics I know. We should continue a clear Uptrend with very Short Consolidation phases that are characteristic of accumulation, so do not be scared when you see that small pullback. I expect this to be the beginning of a Long Uptrend cycle.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is already breaking into the ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô, attempting to reach the next Short term Neutral major pivot point at the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week LOW at $0.00001370. This will be the accumulation area where it looks like Consolidation. At MAX, the price is going to follow Targets, and we are going to attempt to reach the 1st Target at the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001470. Beyond that, the 2nd Target would be the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH at $0.00001580. Should this be a one-off spike, the market will pull back within the existing Neutral range between $0.00001330 and $0.00001320. This level is just ABOVE the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô, so it would be acceptable to see the market return to this level; however, if the price falls BELOW it, one must assess whether an external catalyst or an internal market dynamic is at work. At LOWEST, the market will have the potential to reach down to the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001270.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life.

Momentum Indicators show ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô increasing the pressure on Seller positions to shake out the last of the Weak conviction profit-taking. This rapid pressure across multiple time frames has led to those few remaining Sellers exercising very Weak control over the market. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is rising WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, confirming a Bullish Consolidation and Uptrend cycle. Bollinger Bands are following that small incremental movement, which is a characteristic dynamic of the market that indicates Consolidation, while underlying this is a ballooning breakout pressure building. ADX values seem to have captured the very beginning of the Uptrend, moving with Average Trend strength and holding the price ABOVE the Superrend and all EMAs to confirm an active level of renewed ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô. Volatility Indicators continue to support the Bollinger Bands breakout signal, with Volatility holding firm in the Neutral of our norms range. Prices are confirming the Uptrend cycle by elevating through the Volatility Bands and rising ABOVE the HIGH Bands. This further highlights the Bullish Consolidation phase leading into a breakout cycle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Volume Indicators are confirming the profit-taking, as the reduced level of participation reflects the exit of those Short Sellers, while Long term participation remains stable to show ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô. Despite these matching levels of participation, ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô is strategically moving more money into the market than Sellers are moving out.  Sentiment Indicators highlight the Strong accumulation phase that ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô has sustained, which has now begun entering its Neutral cycle. This emerging positive Trend cycle will add accelerated strength to the Long term positive Trend if sustained over multiple time frames. News articles have seemingly killed the MEME narrative and are specifically highlighting the Utility aspects of Shiba Inu. Articles emphasizing the size of token burns, technical signals that support incoming highs, and admiration for strategic developments like the Shibarium integration all use positive fact-based coverage to highlight the Resistances and Volumes. This Bullish Long term narrative continues to counter FUD/FOMO while reminding investors of both the potentials and the challenges ahead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I follow my own methodologies, and based on how I see and assess market dynamics, everything is beginning to be characteristic of the expected next phase: ‚ÄòBreakout Initiation‚Äô. Usually, the breakout marks a transition where balance shifts from accumulation to a clear Uptrend. In the Short term, we will need to validate the breakout to rule out a one-off spike, but my expectation is that this follows the dynamics I know. We should continue a clear Uptrend with very Short Consolidation phases that are characteristic of accumulation, so do not be scared when you see that small pullback. I expect this to be the beginning of a Long Uptrend cycle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is already breaking into the ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô, attempting to reach the next Short term Neutral major pivot point at the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week LOW at $0.00001370. This will be the accumulation area where it looks like Consolidation. At MAX, the price is going to follow Targets, and we are going to attempt to reach the 1st Target at the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001470. Beyond that, the 2nd Target would be the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH at $0.00001580. Should this be a one-off spike, the market will pull back within the existing Neutral range between $0.00001330 and $0.00001320. This level is just ABOVE the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô, so it would be acceptable to see the market return to this level; however, if the price falls BELOW it, one must assess whether an external catalyst or an internal market dynamic is at work. At LOWEST, the market will have the potential to reach down to the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001270.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support.

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nLooks like ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô has moved through about the last of the ‚ÄòSell Wall‚Äô with Weak conviction Sellers exiting as the price takes one last dip. The accelerated pace of the ‚ÄòSell Wall‚Äô convinced ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô to rapidly take those positions in response, rather than allowing Volatility to drive the price higher and become exit liquidity for hacker laundering and Weak conviction Sellers. This strategy has lured out the majority of the remaining Sellers in the Long term cycle. Momentum Indicators show Oversold conditions for the Sellers holding Weak levels of control over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators signal that despite the Weak pullback into a Bearish Consolidation, the price is hovering AT the Ichimoku Cloud‚Äôs LOW Band while still remaining WITHIN the Cloud, confirming the Consolidation of the Downtrend. Bollinger Bands appear to be increasing in value, which would normally signal Consolidation in line with our Ichimoku Cloud reading, but I can see a bubble of breakout strength growing from this increase. ADX values continue to reveal Average Trend strength while the price is firmly BELOW the Supertrend and all EMAs, indicating a lack of ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô. Volatility Indicators continue to support the breakout signal from the Bollinger Band contraction, with Volatility staying in the Neutral of our norms range. Price movements continue to place pressure against the LOW Volatility Bands, showing the market's attempts to break out and return to the Neutral range established by those Bands.\n\nVolume Indicators highlight a sharp increase in participation, suggesting that ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô is grabbing the market and moving more money in than Sellers can move out, even though we remain in Oversold conditions. Sentiment Indicators show that Strong strategic accumulation by ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô is outpacing Sellers, who appear to have reached the MAX strength of their exit from the market as the Short term Negative Trend cycle grows Stronger and approaches what I would consider peak values. Despite some perceived victories by Sellers, the market has sustained its Long term positive Trend cycle, as evidenced by the resilient PVT value. News articles reinforce the changing narrative from MEME to Utility by focusing on technical breakout signals, token burn events, and ecosystem utility developments that further drive investor confidence and hint at incoming HIGHS. However, cautious articles also highlight declining Volume and Sell Walls; this fact-based narrative underscores the market‚Äôs obvious challenges and serves to further alleviate FUD/FOMO.\n\nI think the market is at a pivotal moment where the last of the Weak conviction Sellers and the sheer depth of the ‚ÄòSell Wall‚Äô have been exposed. In this strategic moment, ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô is modestly taking positions while still leaving room for retail investors to participate. We have encouraging Volume combined with breakout signals, and I see Strong Support at the bottom of the market when you consider everything that has influenced us over the past 6 months. After all of that, this is as LOW as the market is going to go. This further affirms that we are almost done with Consolidation and that the market is nearly poised for a breakout in appreciation. Be on the lookout for ‚ÄòBlack Swan Fakeout Events‚Äô, where the market might run sideways in Consolidation after a pullback. This will look like a quick, volatile spike in price followed by a return to this price level. That is not the scenario I see happening, but I like to keep you aware of all possibilities. In essence, I am implying that you should keep your stop losses in place to protect your gains.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is resting AT the expected stall range WITHIN the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô where we have tested our LOW Support range. At LOWEST, the market is going to try to test the full breadth of the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô down to the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001270. I will put out the 2nd Target BELOW this BOTTOM; however, due to ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô moving so strategically, it is very unlikely that we will reach the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW at $0.0001220. That would, however, constitute a market TRUE BOTTOM where we would need to start assessing what is going wrong. At MAX, we are on a path to regain the Neutral zone of our Short  and Long term market, which lies between the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001360 and the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001330. This would constitute a 1st Target to recapture that zone, then the market will look to take the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week LOW at $0.00001390. As a bonus, the next Target beyond that is the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.0001500.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they‚Äôre the most important to you in the world.\n\nThe petition still needs your help.

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looks like ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô has moved through about the last of the ‚ÄòSell Wall‚Äô with Weak conviction Sellers exiting as the price takes one last dip. The accelerated pace of the ‚ÄòSell Wall‚Äô convinced ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô to rapidly take those positions in response, rather than allowing Volatility to drive the price higher and become exit liquidity for hacker laundering and Weak conviction Sellers. This strategy has lured out the majority of the remaining Sellers in the Long term cycle. Momentum Indicators show Oversold conditions for the Sellers holding Weak levels of control over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators signal that despite the Weak pullback into a Bearish Consolidation, the price is hovering AT the Ichimoku Cloud‚Äôs LOW Band while still remaining WITHIN the Cloud, confirming the Consolidation of the Downtrend. Bollinger Bands appear to be increasing in value, which would normally signal Consolidation in line with our Ichimoku Cloud reading, but I can see a bubble of breakout strength growing from this increase. ADX values continue to reveal Average Trend strength while the price is firmly BELOW the Supertrend and all EMAs, indicating a lack of ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô. Volatility Indicators continue to support the breakout signal from the Bollinger Band contraction, with Volatility staying in the Neutral of our norms range. Price movements continue to place pressure against the LOW Volatility Bands, showing the market&amp;#39;s attempts to break out and return to the Neutral range established by those Bands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Volume Indicators highlight a sharp increase in participation, suggesting that ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô is grabbing the market and moving more money in than Sellers can move out, even though we remain in Oversold conditions. Sentiment Indicators show that Strong strategic accumulation by ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô is outpacing Sellers, who appear to have reached the MAX strength of their exit from the market as the Short term Negative Trend cycle grows Stronger and approaches what I would consider peak values. Despite some perceived victories by Sellers, the market has sustained its Long term positive Trend cycle, as evidenced by the resilient PVT value. News articles reinforce the changing narrative from MEME to Utility by focusing on technical breakout signals, token burn events, and ecosystem utility developments that further drive investor confidence and hint at incoming HIGHS. However, cautious articles also highlight declining Volume and Sell Walls; this fact-based narrative underscores the market‚Äôs obvious challenges and serves to further alleviate FUD/FOMO.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the market is at a pivotal moment where the last of the Weak conviction Sellers and the sheer depth of the ‚ÄòSell Wall‚Äô have been exposed. In this strategic moment, ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô is modestly taking positions while still leaving room for retail investors to participate. We have encouraging Volume combined with breakout signals, and I see Strong Support at the bottom of the market when you consider everything that has influenced us over the past 6 months. After all of that, this is as LOW as the market is going to go. This further affirms that we are almost done with Consolidation and that the market is nearly poised for a breakout in appreciation. Be on the lookout for ‚ÄòBlack Swan Fakeout Events‚Äô, where the market might run sideways in Consolidation after a pullback. This will look like a quick, volatile spike in price followed by a return to this price level. That is not the scenario I see happening, but I like to keep you aware of all possibilities. In essence, I am implying that you should keep your stop losses in place to protect your gains.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is resting AT the expected stall range WITHIN the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô where we have tested our LOW Support range. At LOWEST, the market is going to try to test the full breadth of the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô down to the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001270. I will put out the 2nd Target BELOW this BOTTOM; however, due to ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô moving so strategically, it is very unlikely that we will reach the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW at $0.0001220. That would, however, constitute a market TRUE BOTTOM where we would need to start assessing what is going wrong. At MAX, we are on a path to regain the Neutral zone of our Short  and Long term market, which lies between the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001360 and the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001330. This would constitute a 1st Target to recapture that zone, then the market will look to take the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week LOW at $0.00001390. As a bonus, the next Target beyond that is the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.0001500.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they‚Äôre the most important to you in the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The petition still needs your help.

          "selftext": "Good evening everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nWell, my area received an intense storm, and it's not confirmed yet whether there was a tornado in it or not, but it was a chaotic day nonetheless. It brings me a sense of peace and back to normal getting to the analysis again.\n\nMomentum Indicators show that ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô is still holding against the ‚ÄòSell Wall‚Äô and have begun to smooth the rate of change in their favor, gaining a Weak level of control over the market. Trend Indicators highlight the price BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, confirming a Consolidation phase. Bollinger Bands are contracting sharply, which is an early signal for breakout pressure building. ADX values indicate Average Trend strength with the price BELOW the Supertrend and all EMAs. This means Bearish Consolidation. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Band contraction with Volatility values falling yet staying WITHIN the Neutral of our norms range. The price's implied stability holds just BELOW the Volatility Bands, which further supports the Bollinger Bands' early signal of breakout pressure building as the price will look to reach back within those Volatility Bands acting as Support and Resistance levels. \n\nVolume Indicators signal increasing participation with ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô now beginning to move more money into the market than is being moved out by Sellers. Sentiment Indicators reveal the strength of ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô accumulation holding at Strong levels, and though we see a Short term Negative Trend cycle, they have further strengthened the Long term positive Trend cycle as seen by the increased PVT value. News articles remain optimistic, highlighting token burns, technical analysis that supports price appreciation, and coverage of ecosystem achievements as they continue to cover the evolution from MEME to Utility. News offers few negative insights but did use Neutral articles that contain fact-based insights to continue helping alleviate FUD/FOMO while offering realistic caution for challenges associated with this asset class in general.\n\nSeeing as this continues to follow a basic dynamic of a ‚ÄòShakeout‚Äô phase, I see that the Indicators are showing the weakness of the ‚ÄòSell Wall‚Äô beginning and the strength of our ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô taking control of the market. We will likely continue through a Bearish Consolidation phase where I see us begin to level out and run sideways for a little bit before continuing a new positive Trend cycle of price appreciation.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances show that we are resting just ABOVE the Short term Neutral major pivot point at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001330. This is roughly the Neutral ground for the current market where price movements would expectedly stay between the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001360 down to that Short term at $0.00001330. At MAX, the price will break out and continue up to the next retracement level at the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week LOW at $0.00001390. The thing is we lack ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô currently; I wouldn't expect us to reach the next retracement level but potentially just to break over the 2nd level pivot point and reach a stall zone where the 3-Day and 10-Day moving averages converge at $0.00001410. After that, the market would assess the next direction. At LOWEST, the price will reach down and test the TOP of the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô with the potential to make it into a well-defined stall range where the 3-Day, 10-Day, 16-Day MACD moving averages converge at $0.00001320. If somehow we breach that level, we're just going to head to the next retracement lower than that at the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001270 at LOWEST based upon the participation of ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô currently.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life.

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nAs I suspected, the Buyers have a tedious task shaking out the Sellers from the ‚ÄòSell Wall‚Äô as they continue to accumulate at a steady pace, counteracting the Sell pressure. Momentum Indicators show the Neutral ground developing as ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô Buyers smooth the rate of change over multiple time frames, yet the ‚ÄòSell Wall‚Äô is so large that Sellers remain in a Weak level of control over the market. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, while Bollinger Bands are behaving as they did previously, moving in small incremental values that neither firmly outline a breakout nor a breakdown but support an outlook of Consolidation. ADX values signal an increasingly Bullish Trend strength holding the price NEAR the Supertrend and Short term EMAs while remaining ABOVE the 200-Day EMA, verifying the lingering resilience of ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô. Volatility Indicators provide greater clarity to the Bollinger Bands and support the Consolidation outlook, with Volatility remaining in the Neutral of our norms range. Price movements continue to remain WITHIN the Volatility Bands, further confirming Consolidation and the Downtrend pressure placed against the LOW Bands.\n\nVolume Indicators show increased participation, meaning that the current price level is an attractive entry point for dip buying. Despite the massive size of the ‚ÄòSell Wall‚Äô, for now the money flow is Weak, with more money moving out of the market than in. Sentiment Indicators continue to highlight Strong distribution from the ‚ÄòSell Wall‚Äô, yet ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô Buyers have cut that level in half with the increased level of accumulation. This counteracting pressure has begun nurturing and building Strong Support in a newly emerging Neutral Trend cycle. Despite the counteracting pressures, we remain in a Long term positive Trend cycle, with Sellers barely making a dent in the Support built by ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô. News articles continue the Bullish narrative shift from MEME to Utility with coverage of token burns and Strong technical indicators that support the outlook of an incoming rally and gains. While remaining fact-based to counter FUD/FOMO, the News cautions about hacker laundering issues as part of the massive ‚ÄòSell Wall‚Äô, reminding investors of the realistic challenges ahead.\n\nI see this as the dynamic it is, and so we are still experiencing that ‚ÄòShakeout‚Äô phase as part of ‚ÄòBase Building‚Äô. The Indicators highlight some mixed signals, but overall, due to the clear negative counterbalance, we are likely to continue to experience further Downtrend pressure as we test the LOW Support channels. Most likely this will lead to Consolidation, as we have such Strong Support built through these LOW price levels due to ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô accumulation.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances show the price testing the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô, resting just ABOVE the 1st Target LOWEST Neutral major pivot point at the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001330. At LOWEST, we will seek the 2nd Target LOWEST at the 50% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001270. Breaking this level establishes the 3rd Target LOWEST at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001220, which becomes a more CRITICAL BOTTOM price level for the market to approach. 1st Target MAX will be to reclaim the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001390. This price point also aligns with the 38.2% retracement of our 13-Week LOW, which acts as the Short term Neutral major pivot point. 2nd Target MAX rests at the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001500.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they‚Äôre the most important to you in the world.\n\nThe petition still needs your help. Make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.\n\nPetition:\n\nhttps://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition",

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nThis ‚ÄòBase Building‚Äô phase is becoming quite interesting, as ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô only needed to sit on the sidelines in a wait-and-see phase to shake out the Weak Longs and Short Sellers. Momentum Indicators show that Buyers are holding on the sidelines, grabbing positions from Sellers at a LOW but stable rate, while the market shakes out Weak conviction and presses Short Sellers through the ‚ÄòSell Wall‚Äô. This Bearish Consolidation has reached Oversold yet only gives Sellers an Average level of control over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, which confirms the Bearish Consolidation. However, when you look at the Bollinger Bands, they give an early signal of breakout pressure building as the Bands are contracting sharply. ADX values show Strong Trend strength with the price BELOW the Supertrend and Short term EMAs while still remaining ABOVE the 200-Day EMA. This supports the Bearish Consolidation and reveals resilient underlying ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô. Volatility Indicators support the early breakout signal from the Bollinger Bands, with Volatility falling to the Neutral of our norms range. Prices falling BELOW the LOW Volatility Bands highlight the outlook of Bearish Consolidation following a pullback, and in this dynamic the price will seek to return to this range, which further supports the early signal of breakout pressure building.\n\nVolume Indicators also support this outlook as Short term participation is increasing rapidly, meaning that ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô is grabbing these positions in the Downtrend at a stable rate. Yet there is quite a bit of ground to work through, as Sellers have moved the market into an Oversold position with more money flowing out than in. Sentiment Indicators are predictably showing the Strong distribution from the ‚ÄòSell Wall‚Äô and the strength of the Short term negative Trend cycle. However, when you look at the PVT value retaining that Strong Bullish positive Trend cycle, it implies that this is a temporary pullback. News articles continue the narrative outlining the change from MEME to Utility by covering large token burn events and technical signals that support incoming HIGHS and explosive gains. New keeps a fact-based narrative that helps counter FUD/FOMO by highlighting the obvious large ‚ÄòSell Wall‚Äô.\n\nThe thing is, the market seems to be in a strategic position following measurable dynamics. I would expect some Short term weakness through this Bearish Consolidation phase while ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô continues to accumulate and shake out the Weak Longs from the ‚ÄòSell Wall‚Äô. This could be a tedious process, but that will only ensure greater stability for the recovery Uptrend to come. This dynamic step is called the ‚ÄòTest and Shakeout‚Äô phase. I'm happy that the next dynamic phase is the true breakout phase, so keep an eye on Volume surges and prices that begin closing ABOVE some of our Resistances, which will signal the end of the next phase of accumulation. But what's really nice is the ‚ÄòMarkup‚Äô phase that follows; I'll leave that to your imagination until we get there, as I will explain it in more detail then.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances show that we are holding WITHIN the Neutral zone at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH, which is acting as our Short term Neutral major pivot point. Our market is getting ready to move into ‚ÄòTarget‚Äô dynamics and Strong ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô, so I will break this down by 1st Target and 2nd Target, MAX and LOWEST. 1st Target MAX will be the 50% retracement of our 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001520. 2nd Target MAX will be the 38.2% retracement of our 13-Week HIGH at $0.00001640. 1st Target LOWEST will be the 50% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290. 2nd Target LOWEST, also constituting the current market BOTTOM, is at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230. Interestingly, this market BOTTOM is not the true CRITICAL level mathematically, but hitting it would still be significant. Don't worry, though, because what it would take to move to CRITICAL levels is like a major global catastrophe, a type of event that shakes out the whales with nerves of steel.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they‚Äôre the most important to you in the world.\n\nThe petition still needs your help.

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This ‚ÄòBase Building‚Äô phase is becoming quite interesting, as ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô only needed to sit on the sidelines in a wait-and-see phase to shake out the Weak Longs and Short Sellers. Momentum Indicators show that Buyers are holding on the sidelines, grabbing positions from Sellers at a LOW but stable rate, while the market shakes out Weak conviction and presses Short Sellers through the ‚ÄòSell Wall‚Äô. This Bearish Consolidation has reached Oversold yet only gives Sellers an Average level of control over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, which confirms the Bearish Consolidation. However, when you look at the Bollinger Bands, they give an early signal of breakout pressure building as the Bands are contracting sharply. ADX values show Strong Trend strength with the price BELOW the Supertrend and Short term EMAs while still remaining ABOVE the 200-Day EMA. This supports the Bearish Consolidation and reveals resilient underlying ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô. Volatility Indicators support the early breakout signal from the Bollinger Bands, with Volatility falling to the Neutral of our norms range. Prices falling BELOW the LOW Volatility Bands highlight the outlook of Bearish Consolidation following a pullback, and in this dynamic the price will seek to return to this range, which further supports the early signal of breakout pressure building.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Volume Indicators also support this outlook as Short term participation is increasing rapidly, meaning that ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô is grabbing these positions in the Downtrend at a stable rate. Yet there is quite a bit of ground to work through, as Sellers have moved the market into an Oversold position with more money flowing out than in. Sentiment Indicators are predictably showing the Strong distribution from the ‚ÄòSell Wall‚Äô and the strength of the Short term negative Trend cycle. However, when you look at the PVT value retaining that Strong Bullish positive Trend cycle, it implies that this is a temporary pullback. News articles continue the narrative outlining the change from MEME to Utility by covering large token burn events and technical signals that support incoming HIGHS and explosive gains. New keeps a fact-based narrative that helps counter FUD/FOMO by highlighting the obvious large ‚ÄòSell Wall‚Äô.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thing is, the market seems to be in a strategic position following measurable dynamics. I would expect some Short term weakness through this Bearish Consolidation phase while ‚ÄòSmart Money‚Äô continues to accumulate and shake out the Weak Longs from the ‚ÄòSell Wall‚Äô. This could be a tedious process, but that will only ensure greater stability for the recovery Uptrend to come. This dynamic step is called the ‚ÄòTest and Shakeout‚Äô phase. I&amp;#39;m happy that the next dynamic phase is the true breakout phase, so keep an eye on Volume surges and prices that begin closing ABOVE some of our Resistances, which will signal the end of the next phase of accumulation. But what&amp;#39;s really nice is the ‚ÄòMarkup‚Äô phase that follows; I&amp;#39;ll leave that to your imagination until we get there, as I will explain it in more detail then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long term Support and Resistances show that we are holding WITHIN the Neutral zone at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH, which is acting as our Short term Neutral major pivot point. Our market is getting ready to move into ‚ÄòTarget‚Äô dynamics and Strong ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô, so I will break this down by 1st Target and 2nd Target, MAX and LOWEST. 1st Target MAX will be the 50% retracement of our 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001520. 2nd Target MAX will be the 38.2% retracement of our 13-Week HIGH at $0.00001640. 1st Target LOWEST will be the 50% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290. 2nd Target LOWEST, also constituting the current market BOTTOM, is at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230. Interestingly, this market BOTTOM is not the true CRITICAL level mathematically, but hitting it would still be significant. Don&amp;#39;t worry, though, because what it would take to move to CRITICAL levels is like a major global catastrophe, a type of event that shakes out the whales with nerves of steel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they‚Äôre the most important to you in the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The petition still needs your help.

Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Petition:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition\"&gt;https://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
