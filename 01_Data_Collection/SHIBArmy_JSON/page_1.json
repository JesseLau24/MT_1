          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nBuyers are continuing to grab everything that the ‘Sell Wall’ lets go of through the dips, and are sustaining an Uptrend cycle. Momentum Indicators show that as the price appreciates further, the rate at which Sellers continue to offload (just as we approach their price level) is creating an opportunity for ‘Smart Money’ Buyers to take these positions and smooth the rate of change to a Neutral level while exerting and taking even greater control of the market in the Short term. Trend Indicators signal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, placing pressure against the HIGH Band, while Bollinger Bands continue to expand, highlighting a Bullish Consolidation phase with building breakout pressure. ADX values indicate Average Trend strength holding the price ABOVE the Supertrend and our Long term EMAs, while showing the 12-Day EMA to be a level of Support/Resistance. This continues to highlight active ‘Price Action’, though. Volatility Indicators support the Bullish Consolidation of the Bollinger Band expansion, with Volatility rising to the HIGH end of our norms range. Price movements continue to hold WITHIN the Volatility Bands while placing pressure against the HIGH Bands to support an outlook of Uptrend continuation and Bullish Consolidation.\n\nVolume Indicators show reduced participation from investors, yet that pullback is beginning to slow down. Despite the ‘Smart Money’ accumulation, the ‘Sell Wall’ has begun moving more money out of the market than in. Sentiment Indicators reveal Strong levels of distribution from Sellers, leading to Neutral Short term pressure, yet ‘Smart Money’ accumulation was enough to further strengthen the Long term positive Trend cycle and cultivate an Uptrend breakout. News articles are shifting focus with an even more Bullish narrative for Shiba Inu, using headlines that forecast explosive moves supported by technical indicators and ecosystem upgrades such as the Shibarium dApp store. News shows some of the hurdles from the resistance barriers and shifting leadership signals, inviting a balanced perspective that continues to help mitigate FUD/FOMO while still acknowledging SHIB's Utility potential.\n\nIn the way I'm looking at these Indicators, it appears as if we're starting to see Momentum and Volume begin to falter due to a lack of Buy support. In the Short term, we'll see Sell pressure dominate the Volume, which will lead to a Consolidation phase or a minor pullback toward Support prices. This will pick up Buyers in the dips, leading to a renewal of the breakout Uptrend. This is an actual industry dynamic, which is referred to as an ‘Accumulation Phase’. I like to call it a ‘Base Building Phase’ because of how I see things in my mind; but unlike Bullish Consolidation, the ‘Smart Money’ is stepping in during pullbacks, and our dips aren't being viewed as weakness but rather as attractive entry points that reinforce the underlying Uptrend over the Long term. Some of my favorite investors and analysts use a Wyckoff framework, and this behavior of the market fits that dynamic perfectly.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances indicate that we are resting at a Short term Neutral major pivot point at the 38.2% retracement of our 13-Week LOW at $0.00001410. We have confirmed the market's preference for retracement levels. At MAX, the market will attempt to capture the 50% retracement of our 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001520 as the 1st target. To extend that, in the event of a continued breakout, the 2nd target would be the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH at $0.00001640. At LOWEST, following the retracements, the price will pull back to the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001360. To continue on, a 2nd target breakdown would extend the LOWEST potential to the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.\n\nThe petition still needs your help. Make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.\n\nPetition:\n\nhttps://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition",

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Buyers are continuing to grab everything that the ‘Sell Wall’ lets go of through the dips, and are sustaining an Uptrend cycle. Momentum Indicators show that as the price appreciates further, the rate at which Sellers continue to offload (just as we approach their price level) is creating an opportunity for ‘Smart Money’ Buyers to take these positions and smooth the rate of change to a Neutral level while exerting and taking even greater control of the market in the Short term. Trend Indicators signal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, placing pressure against the HIGH Band, while Bollinger Bands continue to expand, highlighting a Bullish Consolidation phase with building breakout pressure. ADX values indicate Average Trend strength holding the price ABOVE the Supertrend and our Long term EMAs, while showing the 12-Day EMA to be a level of Support/Resistance. This continues to highlight active ‘Price Action’, though. Volatility Indicators support the Bullish Consolidation of the Bollinger Band expansion, with Volatility rising to the HIGH end of our norms range. Price movements continue to hold WITHIN the Volatility Bands while placing pressure against the HIGH Bands to support an outlook of Uptrend continuation and Bullish Consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Volume Indicators show reduced participation from investors, yet that pullback is beginning to slow down. Despite the ‘Smart Money’ accumulation, the ‘Sell Wall’ has begun moving more money out of the market than in. Sentiment Indicators reveal Strong levels of distribution from Sellers, leading to Neutral Short term pressure, yet ‘Smart Money’ accumulation was enough to further strengthen the Long term positive Trend cycle and cultivate an Uptrend breakout. News articles are shifting focus with an even more Bullish narrative for Shiba Inu, using headlines that forecast explosive moves supported by technical indicators and ecosystem upgrades such as the Shibarium dApp store. News shows some of the hurdles from the resistance barriers and shifting leadership signals, inviting a balanced perspective that continues to help mitigate FUD/FOMO while still acknowledging SHIB&amp;#39;s Utility potential.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the way I&amp;#39;m looking at these Indicators, it appears as if we&amp;#39;re starting to see Momentum and Volume begin to falter due to a lack of Buy support. In the Short term, we&amp;#39;ll see Sell pressure dominate the Volume, which will lead to a Consolidation phase or a minor pullback toward Support prices. This will pick up Buyers in the dips, leading to a renewal of the breakout Uptrend. This is an actual industry dynamic, which is referred to as an ‘Accumulation Phase’. I like to call it a ‘Base Building Phase’ because of how I see things in my mind; but unlike Bullish Consolidation, the ‘Smart Money’ is stepping in during pullbacks, and our dips aren&amp;#39;t being viewed as weakness but rather as attractive entry points that reinforce the underlying Uptrend over the Long term. Some of my favorite investors and analysts use a Wyckoff framework, and this behavior of the market fits that dynamic perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long term Support and Resistances indicate that we are resting at a Short term Neutral major pivot point at the 38.2% retracement of our 13-Week LOW at $0.00001410. We have confirmed the market&amp;#39;s preference for retracement levels. At MAX, the market will attempt to capture the 50% retracement of our 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001520 as the 1st target. To extend that, in the event of a continued breakout, the 2nd target would be the 38.2% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH at $0.00001640. At LOWEST, following the retracements, the price will pull back to the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001360. To continue on, a 2nd target breakdown would extend the LOWEST potential to the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The petition still needs your help.

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nBuyers are plowing through the ‘Sell Wall’ and are now accumulating at an aggressive pace. Momentum Indicators show that Buyers are capturing the Short term market and scooping up positions as they have increased their levels of control over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, attempting to break out, while Bollinger Bands are beginning to expand and highlight a Short term Bullish Consolidation of the gains. ADX values show Average Trend strength holding the price ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs, confirming active ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Band expansion, with Volatility rising to the HIGH end of our norms range. Price movements are attempting to place pressure on the HIGH Volatility Bands, further supporting a Bullish Consolidation and giving an early signal for breakout continuation.\n\nVolume Indicators highlight the ‘Sell Wall’ quite well. Despite reduced levels of participation, more money is flowing into the market than out, and the market is held at a strength just below Overbought conditions, which means that a few participants are contending with this massive ‘Sell Wall’ as if it is nothing. Sentiment Indicators reveal that the few Buyers in the market are aggressively accumulating at Strong levels, massively dwarfing the levels of distribution from the Sellers and elevating the market further into a positive Long term Trend cycle. News articles remain optimistic, with a Bullish Utility narrative covering explosive burn rates, technical breakouts, and ecosystem upgrades. The News also cautions about the massive resistance Sell barrier and covers internal development team warnings, but overall these headwinds provide a balanced counterpart that helps alleviate FUD/FOMO with a fact-driven outlook.\n\nWe have a Bullish technical setup with Strong Buy pressure and active ‘Price Action’; however, with the Volume headwinds becoming so resilient, the market may be vulnerable to shallow pullbacks. I see, for now, Sentiment and whale accumulation will continue maintaining the Uptrend cycle through short Consolidations.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances indicate that we are resting just ABOVE the Short term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001360. This 4-Week retracement level shows us that the price is ABOVE a Neutral zone and is looking to continue retracing averages. At MAX, the current pressure can sustain the price up to the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001520. At LOWEST, the price will fall BELOW the Long term Neutral major pivot point WITHIN the ‘Wall of Support’ down to the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.\n\nThe petition still needs your help. Make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.\n\nPetition:\n\nhttps://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition",

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nWe pulled back as expected to a Short Consolidation phase, which opened up a Buy opportunity for investors in the dip. Momentum Indicators signal that, despite some profit-taking and Buyers entering a wait-and-see phase, the dip allowed Buyers to maintain a Weak level of control in comparison to the Sellers’ participation. Trend Indicators show that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, which is a Bullish signal, and when we combine this with the contraction of the Bollinger Bands, we get an early indication of breakout pressure building following a Bullish Consolidation. ADX values show Average Trend strength while the price trades ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs, verifying active levels of ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Band contraction as Volatility remains in the Neutral of our norms range. Price stability holding WITHIN the Volatility Bands, along with increasing averages, supports Bullish Consolidation and the potential for breakout pressure.\n\nVolume Indicators reveal increased Short term participation, which means that dip Buying is occurring despite the LOW level of activity. However, overall, Sellers and profit-taking moved more money out of the market than in. Sentiment Indicators highlight Strong distribution from profit-taking Sellers, which in the Short term has overtaken the rate of accumulation from Buyers, creating a new emerging negative Trend cycle. Despite this Consolidation, the Buyers were able to sustain the Long term positive Trend cycle, as seen by the increasingly positive PVT value. News articles remain Bullish, with reports of token burns, breakout signals, and optimistic price targets that continue to strengthen the positive narrative and highlight the evolution from MEME to Utility. There are articles highlighting headwinds such as ‘Death Cross’ warnings and a major correction, but overall these narratives are geared toward continuing to mitigate FUD/FOMO through fact-based insights, which only reinforce investor confidence.\n\nI see the market at a crossroads where, on one hand, we have some clear Bullish signals of ‘Price Action’, yet on the other hand, underperforming headwinds are developing due to Buyers losing Momentum as they gauge the market for clear direction. I think this crossroads creates an opportunity for Buy Volume to increase and revive Momentum, but we need to be aware of the Consolidation phases, as the market will likely continue running sideways until everyone gets an idea of what direction to go instead of just providing exit liquidity for a Sell Wall.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances show that the price is resting AT the Short term Neutral major pivot point, which is basically aligned with the Long term Neutral major pivot point, at $0.00001350. Given the tightness of this range, prices could become quite volatile and move in either direction. At MAX, the price will attempt to reach the 38.2% retracement of our 13-Week LOW at $0.00001410. At LOWEST, the price is going to reach down WITHIN the ‘Wall of Support’ to the 50% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290. Because this market could go in either direction, I will extend the range to a TOP breakout beyond MAX to be the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001520. The BOTTOM, past the LOWEST breakdown, would be the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.\n\nThe petition still needs your help.

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nBuyers are growing more and more Bullish and beginning to chip away at the Sell Wall, but profit-taking seems to be cooling the market as the counteracting pressure is leading to Consolidation. Momentum Indicators signal that Buyers are increasing their positions over multiple time frames without reaching Overbought. Trend Indicators show that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, but given the attraction of the price to that HIGH Band and the continued expansion of the Bollinger Bands, this confirms a Bullish Consolidation phase. ADX values reveal Strong Trend strength holding the price ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs, confirming resilient levels of ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Band expansion with Volatility rising even further into the Neutral of our norms range. Price movements remain well ABOVE the Volatility Bands, supporting an outlook of Bullish Consolidation.\n\nVolume Indicators signal reduced participation, yet the few that are buying are counteracting a massive Sell Wall and continue to move more money into the market than out. Sentiment Indicators continue to highlight Strong levels of accumulation greater than the profit-taking distribution, which has flipped the Long term negative Trend cycle and established a positive Trend cycle. News articles continue the positive narrative by covering ecosystem milestones, burn events, and breakout signals that seem to further the shifting from MEME to Utility. At the same time, there are cautions regarding technical Resistances and ecosystem warnings that work to temper FUD/FOMO by using fact-based analysis.\n\nWe are continuing to run Bullish and Buyers are showing greater levels of control while the Sentiment remains very positive. Despite some of the Volume headwinds, if you have been following along with my process, Sentiment accounts for 49.84% of price movement and Volume only accounts for 14.33%. I anticipate that the market will run through a Consolidation phase and may pull back a little, but as we pick up new Buy Volume, this will sustain the Uptrend cycle and prevent a Strong pullback.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is in a Neutral zone, pressed between the Long and Short term Neutral major pivot points, in a range from $0.00001360 down to $0.00001290. At MAX, the price will pick up some Volume and sustain positive Sentiment, reaching up to the 38.2% retracement of our 13-Week LOW at $0.00001420. Breaking ABOVE this level, our next target would be the 50% retracement of our 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001540. At LOWEST, the price will follow the 4-Week retracement levels and reach down WITHIN the ‘Wall of Support’ to the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230. If we fall BELOW this level, the depth of pullback would be the BOTTOM of the ‘Wall of Support’ at the 3rd-level Support pivot point at $0.00001150.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.\n\nThe petition still needs your help.

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nI'm really glad we had this Uptrend cycle because I was excited to watch the dojis play out through the charts, and encouragingly, we have higher HIGHS and higher LOWS. We need to approach this with some caution, though, and breaking it down through the Indicators will help understand a little better what is happening and what we can expect. Momentum Indicators show that Buyers began stepping in, but the stable appreciation was consistently met with profit-taking over multiple time frames, leading to a Weak, Neutral level. Buyers hold a fair amount of control of the market, yet they are chipping away at a ‘Profit-Taking Sell Wall’. Trend Indicators showed that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, which outlines our Bullish Uptrend, yet Bollinger Bands are beginning to expand again, signaling Bullish Consolidation when the two are combined. ADX values signal an Average level of Trend strength holding the price ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs, meaning we currently have a robust level of ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators support Bollinger Band expansion, with Volatility rising to the Neutral end of our norms range. Sustained price movements ABOVE the Volatility Bands support an outlook of pressure building for a Consolidation of gains.\n\nVolume Indicators highlight increased levels of participation, which have kept an even level of counteracting pressure against the profit-taking, leaving money flow at a near-Neutral level, yet more remains flowing in than out. Sentiment Indicators revealed that Buyers are continuing to accumulate at stronger levels than the distribution of profit-taking, which continues to nurture a positive Trend cycle in the Short term, yet the profit-taking continues to lend further strength to the negative Trend cycle, as seen by the decline of the PVT value slipping even further today. News articles were overwhelmingly Bullish with Sentiment for Shiba Inu, with projections of drastic moves, breakout patterns, and technical indicators which are driving a narrative of a substantial rally incoming with the additional, continued shift from MEME to real world adoption and Utility. They have isolated articles with cautions, but these continue to show the ongoing effort to counter FUD/FOMO by using fact-based insights to help investors stay attentive to market dynamics.\n\nThe Trend is clearly Bullish and Buyers are gradually taking greater control of the market, but Volatility continues to remain LOW and, to me, that indicates a Consolidation phase. We continue to have breakouts from some of our Bands, which supports further gains, but Volume at Neutral means that we should expect to continue testing higher Support levels with temporary Consolidations and minor pullbacks. Any surge in Volume would help confirm the market environment for some of the more cautious investors waiting on the sidelines.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is currently testing the ‘Wall of Resistance’, attempting to follow the 4-Week retracement path up to the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001360. As we are BELOW this level, I won't consider this our MAX; rather, it would be the market's attempt to capture a Short term Neutral major pivot point. I see a scenario of Consolidation where there's a defined stall range that I noticed, with the 18-Day moving average resting at $0.00001420 and the 18-Day moving average just BELOW it at $0.00001400. I would say that our MAX would be the height of that stall range, which converges with the 38.2% retracement of our 13-Week LOW at $0.00001420. If we breach this level, we will confirm the 13-Week retracements and establish the 50% retracement of our 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001540 as the next MAX target. At LOWEST, the price will pull back to the 50% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290. If this triggers a stronger pullback, it would fall down to the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001240.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.\n\nThe petition still needs your help.

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nWe entered into Consolidation as expected, but it was quite encouraging to see Buyers step into the dip, meaning they were waiting along the sidelines for entry. Momentum Indicators show that this price stabilization is contending with profit-taking as Buyers lead the market in Weak control over multiple time frames through Bullish Consolidation. Trend Indicators signal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, while Bollinger Bands are expanding, confirming the Consolidation. ADX values show Strong Trend strength holding the price ABOVE the Supertrend and Long term EMAs while remaining BELOW the 12-Day EMA. This signals Trend continuation and highlights stable ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Band expansion with Volatility rising near the Neutral zone but still in the LOW end of our norms range. Price movements are falling near the LOW of our Volatility Bands, remaining WITHIN their range and further supporting Consolidation.\n\nVolume Indicators offer some encouragement by showing increased participation from investors entering the market through the dips and smoothing the flow of money, leaving a Neutral level with barely more continuing to move in than out. Sentiment Indicators reveal Strong accumulation through the dips while nurturing the Short term positive Trend cycle; yet despite the dip buying, profit-taking has lent even more strength to extend the negative Trend cycle, as seen by the PVT value decline even further today. News articles remain Bullish while using technical indicators, token burns, and reversal patterns which continue to reshape the narrative from MEME to Utility. At the same time, they offer caution with signals like scam warnings, potential traps, and Bearish price predictions which work to ease FUD/FOMO by offering fact-based insights.\n\nI can see that Buyers are edging in and the price is sitting comfortably near our Support levels while Volatility remains subdued, and all this is characteristic of Consolidation before a breakout. However, Short term Volume headwinds remain and I can see us continuing with gradual gains where the market might retrace to some of our LOW Band boundaries before establishing a solid breakout. This is an interesting moment.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances reveal that the price is right ABOVE the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230. This acts as our Short term Neutral major pivot point and, given that we are following such defined price dynamics, we may press a little bit lower to test the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001210, which would be the test of the full Neutral range from Short to Long term. At LOWEST, the price will touch the TOP of the ‘Wall of Support’ and cross BELOW the 9-Day moving average at the 1st standard price deviation at $0.00001210. As before, if we breach this level, we would immediately go down to a well-defined stall range where the 3-Day, 10-Day, and 16-Day MACD moving averages converge at $0.00001150. At MAX, the price will continue to try to reach that next 4-Week retracement level at the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290, and this would be the market's attempt to establish a higher Short term Neutral major pivot point. Extending beyond this point would mean that the next test would be our 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001360.\n\nThe petition still needs your help.

Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.\n\nPetition:\n\nhttps://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition",

Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nThe sustained Bullish Uptrend is stimulating Buyer activity in an attempt to get ahead of some of our Volume headwinds in the Short term. Momentum Indicators show that, despite the profit-taking, there is sustained Weak Buyer control over multiple time frames, holding the market just ABOVE some Short term Neutral benchmarks. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, while Bollinger Bands have contracted even further today, which signals a growing outlook for breakout potential to test higher Resistance levels. ADX values show that Trend strength is increasing, while prices are holding ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs, signaling that ‘Price Action’ remains stable. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Band contraction, with Volatility falling even further into the LOWEST end of our norms range. Price movements continue to ride AT or ABOVE the Volatility HIGH Bands, supporting a Bullish Consolidation outlook while also lending a Weak signal to the breakout potential that continues to build up.\n\nVolume Indicators show Weak levels of increasing participation, which is encouraging as these investors are accumulating at greater levels than profit-taking is distributing. This further moves more money into the market than out. Sentiment Indicators continue to signal increasing levels of Strong accumulation, with Buyers continuing to nurture a Short term positive Trend cycle. Despite this Buyer activity, profit-taking has given more strength to the Long term negative Trend cycle, as indicated by the PVT value further declining. News articles continue with a Bullish narrative covering token burns, strategic Shibarium updates, and Bullish price forecasts that evolve the coverage from MEME to Utility asset. While there are highlights of technical barriers, high concentration risk, and some scam warnings, they all help counteract FUD/FOMO while cultivating a positive Long term outlook.\n\nOverall, the Indicators and general Sentiment remain positive and point to a Bullish outlook. The Neutral/mixed Volume signals continue to warrant caution, and I would expect a Consolidation of the gains while we proceed through a Bullish Consolidation phase until Volume increases validate a stronger Long term Uptrend cycle.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances show that the price has breached the ‘Wall of Resistance’ and is attempting to follow the retracement path of the 4-Week levels, but it has run into a stall range as indicated by the convergence of the 3-Day and 14-Day raw stochastic, which has reached 80%, at $0.00001250. At MAX, the price will attempt in the Short term to reach that benchmark 50% retracement level of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290. At LOWEST, the price will pull back to around the previous 38.2% retracement level of the 4‑Week LOW at $0.00001230 for a Short term Consolidation to test market direction. Falling BELOW this level would trigger a test of the ‘Wall of Support’ down to the defined stall range WITHIN the ‘Wall of Support’, where our 3-Day, 10-Day, and 16-Day MACD moving averages converge at $0.00001150.\n\nThe petition still needs your help.

Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.\n\nPetition:\n\nhttps://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition",

Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nWe have a mixed landscape of pressures converging in the market, lending support to the Uptrend following a Short Consolidation as investors gauged the market. Momentum Indicators highlight these resilient pressures by showing Buyers increasing control of the market over multiple time frames, smoothing the price movements into a Bullish Consolidation range. Trend Indicators show the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, while Bollinger Bands hold the same level of breakout potential from yesterday. ADX values are signaling increasing Trend strength through the Short term, while price movements hold ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs. This confirms that Buyers have activated stable levels of ‘Price Action’.\n\nVolatility Indicators continue to support the Bollinger Band contraction as Volatility remains at the LOW end of our norms range. The Bullish Consolidation is well defined, with price movements placing pressure against the HIGH Volatility Bands and supporting the outlook of breakout pressure building. Volume Indicators have fallen to a Neutral level of participation, which creates a little bit of a headwind in the market. Despite the pullback and participation favoring Sellers, the counteracting Long term accumulation is grabbing those profit-taking positions and moving more money into the market than out.\n\nSentiment Indicators reveal that, despite the Sellers’ participation, Buyers are accumulating at a stronger rate than Sellers are distributing. This convergence of Buy and Sell pressure has led the market into a Neutral ground where the Long term negative Trend cycle has nearly been negated but is currently left at a Weak level, which is quite manageable for the market to work back through. News articles paint a Bullish picture with Strong technical signals, breakthrough price levels, and strategic developments that are steering the narrative from a MEME to one of Utility. News appears to be purposefully crafted to alleviate FUD/FOMO by grounding forecasts with factual insights, signaling a genuine shift in Sentiment.\n\nMixed yet encouraging signals confirm that an Uptrend is intact, yet the underlying Bearish pressures could still trigger a Short term pullback. Given these mixed signals, I see the ‘Price Action’ carrying us through Consolidation levels while the market attempts to overcome the Weak Short term Volume headwinds and break Resistance levels down to provide higher levels of Neutral Support.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances show that the price is resting AT the Short term Neutral major pivot point at the 38.2% retracement of the 4‑Week LOW at $0.00001230, resting WITHIN the Neutral zone ABOVE the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001210. As before, at MAX the price will attempt to reach the next milestone retracement level at the 50% retracement of the 4‑Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290. At LOWEST, the price will reach down into the ‘Wall of Support’ at a well-defined stall range where the 3‑Day, 10‑Day, and 16‑Day MACD moving averages converge at $0.00001150.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help.
