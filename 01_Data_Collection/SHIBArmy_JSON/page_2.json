          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nWell, it's obvious that we are testing the 4‚ÄëWeek retracement levels in an attempt to establish higher Neutrals ABOVE Resistance prices, but I don't see an external catalyst, meaning that this is an internal dynamic and I will assess based on clustering. Momentum Indicators show that Buyers step forward and trigger a stable rate of profit-taking as the price appreciation tests the Sell Wall. This Weak level of Buyer control over multiple time frames is already beginning to show signs of being Overbought. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, confirming an Uptrend cycle, while Bollinger Bands are contracting again, hinting at further breakout potential. ADX values support the outlook of a Consolidation of the gains, as Strong Trend strength in the Short term holds the price ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs for a Weak active ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô phase. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Band contraction outlook of breakout potential, with Volatility falling to the LOW of our norms range, while price movements are ABOVE the Volatility Bands, confirming Overbought conditions.\n\nVolume Indicators signal Weak levels of participation despite the Strong price movements, while profit-taking contends with Buyers entering the market, moving more money in than out at a positive but near‚ÄëNeutral flow rate. Sentiment Indicators are showing Strong accumulation with a newly emerging positive Trend cycle in the Short term, yet it is a Long term caution to note that profit-taking at current levels is still enough to have strengthened the Long term negative Trend cycle that the market has yet to fully claw back through and contend with. News articles show stable Long term optimism, with the Bullish narrative using expert forecasts, ecosystem upgrades, initiative progress, and technical signals supporting recovery. News continues its positive influence while painting the picture of a changing recognition for Shiba Inu from MEME to Utility, while using the same Short term Volatility cautions as a way to alleviate FUD/FOMO.\n\nI don't want to follow the general consensus and would like to just look at this in a purely technical way, because I think that, for me, it makes more sense with the elements coming together. We see a Strong Uptrend cycle being confirmed in the Momentum and Trend Indicators, while the price trades ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, EMAs, and the Supertrend, and all of this is converging ABOVE the Bollinger, Donchian, and Keltner Bands. In literal terms of classification, I call this a Consolidation breakout, but we have Volume remaining Neutral, so I'm not sure how much further we can sustain the breakout, as Bullish continuity is especially important ABOVE the 200-Day EMA. I think we need to see Long term accumulation and an improvement in OBV, MFI, and CMF values from our current levels to cultivate a positive Trend cycle of Buying activity. Putting all this together, it shows me that most likely we will Consolidate the gains at some point and may have some Short Uptrend cycles, but without an external catalyst and higher levels of Buyer activity stepping forward to support the Uptrend, it will eventually just peter out over this weekend.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances reveal that the price is WITHIN the ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô just BELOW the 38.2% retracement of our 4‚ÄëWeek LOW, which acts as the Short term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001230. At MAX, the price will attempt to follow the retracement path up to the 50% retracement of our 4‚ÄëWeek HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290. At LOWEST, the price will retreat and test the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô, with the critical level resting at the 3rd‚Äëlevel Support pivot point at $0.00001130.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help.

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nDespite the increase in Buyer activity, it was not quite enough to catalyze the market for a sustained Uptrend, and the market has returned to a Consolidation phase. Momentum Indicators reveal that Buyer activity remains Neutral in the Short term, resulting in Weak control over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators show that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, while Bollinger Bands are beginning to expand. This behavior confirms the Consolidation phase. ADX values indicate that the price is moving with Average Trend strength, hovering just ABOVE the Supertrend and around the EMA levels, which now form a very tight Resistance range. Volatility Indicators support the Consolidation, as Volatility remains at the Neutral of our norms range. The Volatility Bands reinforce the Consolidation outlook. Volume Indicators are showing declining participation, which suggests ongoing profit-taking. When we examine money flow, it is clear that more money is now flowing out of the market than into it after reaching Resistance levels.\n\nSentiment Indicators confirm a pullback with Strong distribution in the market. Despite the profit-taking, Buyers appear to have cultivated an emerging positive Trend cycle that has reduced the strength of the Long term negative Trend cycle, as evidenced by the PVT value moving to a Neutral level. News articles offered a renewed Bullish outlook for the Medium and Long term by covering breakout levels after the Consolidation. News articles paint a Bullish narrative, highlighting expert predictions, technical signals of strategic whale accumulation, and token burns. The same cautions of Short term Volatility remain as a way to alleviate FUD/FOMO, but overall the News is still changing the narrative from MEME to ‚ÄòUtility‚Äô, which is a more fundamental encouragement in comparison to just alleviating psychological pressure by using facts. \n\nThere are some signals of Bullish recovery showing through Momentum and Short term Trend Indicators. However, with the lingering Long term Sell resistance against Uptrends with profit-taking, it is likely that the market will continue Consolidating until an external catalyst stimulates ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances reveal that the price is at the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001180 and is resting within the Neutral zone. At MAX, the price will attempt to reach the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230. At LOWEST, the price will test the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô down to a critical level at the 3rd-level Support pivot point at $0.00001100.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help. Make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.\n\nPetition:\n\nhttps://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition",

Trend Indicators show that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, while Bollinger Bands are beginning to expand. This behavior confirms the Consolidation phase. ADX values indicate that the price is moving with Average Trend strength, hovering just ABOVE the Supertrend and around the EMA levels, which now form a very tight Resistance range. Volatility Indicators support the Consolidation, as Volatility remains at the Neutral of our norms range. The Volatility Bands reinforce the Consolidation outlook. Volume Indicators are showing declining participation, which suggests ongoing profit-taking. When we examine money flow, it is clear that more money is now flowing out of the market than into it after reaching Resistance levels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sentiment Indicators confirm a pullback with Strong distribution in the market. Despite the profit-taking, Buyers appear to have cultivated an emerging positive Trend cycle that has reduced the strength of the Long term negative Trend cycle, as evidenced by the PVT value moving to a Neutral level. News articles offered a renewed Bullish outlook for the Medium and Long term by covering breakout levels after the Consolidation. News articles paint a Bullish narrative, highlighting expert predictions, technical signals of strategic whale accumulation, and token burns. The same cautions of Short term Volatility remain as a way to alleviate FUD/FOMO, but overall the News is still changing the narrative from MEME to ‚ÄòUtility‚Äô, which is a more fundamental encouragement in comparison to just alleviating psychological pressure by using facts. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are some signals of Bullish recovery showing through Momentum and Short term Trend Indicators. However, with the lingering Long term Sell resistance against Uptrends with profit-taking, it is likely that the market will continue Consolidating until an external catalyst stimulates ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long term Support and Resistances reveal that the price is at the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001180 and is resting within the Neutral zone. At MAX, the price will attempt to reach the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230. At LOWEST, the price will test the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô down to a critical level at the 3rd-level Support pivot point at $0.00001100.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they&amp;#39;re the most important to you in the world. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The petition still needs your help.

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nWe‚Äôre right about where we've been over the past couple of days: holding in a sideways Consolidation phase testing both the Support and Resistance ranges. Momentum Indicators show increases in profit-taking, yet only show Sellers coming out with Weak control over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, confirming the Consolidation phase, while Bollinger Bands are doing as they did a few days ago and are increased by a value of 1. This indicates a crossroads of Bearish or Bullish Consolidation, but still continues to hint at breakout potential. ADX values indicate that the current price is moving with resilient, Strong Trend strength extending into the Long time frames, while the price remains BELOW the Supertrend but ABOVE our 12-Day EMA. Though we have some Buyer activity in our dips, we remain BELOW our Long term EMAs, revealing the lack of ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô in the current market. Volatility Indicators seem to support breakout potential, as Volatility has declined to the LOW end of our norms range, while price movements are beginning to place pressure toward the HIGH Volatility Bands. This further seems to support breakout potential.\n\nVolume Indicators signal a small increase in investor participation through both Short and Long term time frames, yet profit-taking has led to more money flowing out of the market than in. Sentiment Indicators now reveal Strong levels of distribution, lending more strength to the Long term negative Trend cycle. New articles continue to highlight technical catalysts and a Long term Bullish bias, using expert forecasts of substantial gains. Despite the Long term narrative of appreciation expectations, the Short term narrative highlights the same Volatility possibilities but uses these articles to urge the use of stop losses and ways to gauge the market through technical signals rather than emotion. Seems that even in a Consolidation phase, the News continues to play an avid role in alleviating FUD/FOMO. \n\nThese charts show me that we're in a position to shift towards Bullish Consolidation, but as Supports and Resistances are holding so firmly, this would only serve to test those levels again before reversing to a Bearish Consolidation. I see hints of Bullish Volatility and Long term Volume accumulation hiding beneath the surface, but these are not yet at a current level that could reverse or catalyze the market. It seems that we are at a crossroads and should expect continued Consolidation.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances indicate that we have reached back up to capture the Neutral zone, resting at the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001190. At MAX, we will reach back up to try to test the old faithful 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230. At LOWEST, we will reach down and test the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô until popular Indicators start showing Oversold conditions and present a Buy opportunity in a dip where the 3rd-level Support pivot point at $0.00001120 would constitute a Support BOTTOM.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help. Make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.\n\nPetition:\n\nhttps://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition",

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôre right about where we&amp;#39;ve been over the past couple of days: holding in a sideways Consolidation phase testing both the Support and Resistance ranges. Momentum Indicators show increases in profit-taking, yet only show Sellers coming out with Weak control over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, confirming the Consolidation phase, while Bollinger Bands are doing as they did a few days ago and are increased by a value of 1. This indicates a crossroads of Bearish or Bullish Consolidation, but still continues to hint at breakout potential. ADX values indicate that the current price is moving with resilient, Strong Trend strength extending into the Long time frames, while the price remains BELOW the Supertrend but ABOVE our 12-Day EMA. Though we have some Buyer activity in our dips, we remain BELOW our Long term EMAs, revealing the lack of ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô in the current market. Volatility Indicators seem to support breakout potential, as Volatility has declined to the LOW end of our norms range, while price movements are beginning to place pressure toward the HIGH Volatility Bands. This further seems to support breakout potential.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Volume Indicators signal a small increase in investor participation through both Short and Long term time frames, yet profit-taking has led to more money flowing out of the market than in. Sentiment Indicators now reveal Strong levels of distribution, lending more strength to the Long term negative Trend cycle. New articles continue to highlight technical catalysts and a Long term Bullish bias, using expert forecasts of substantial gains. Despite the Long term narrative of appreciation expectations, the Short term narrative highlights the same Volatility possibilities but uses these articles to urge the use of stop losses and ways to gauge the market through technical signals rather than emotion. Seems that even in a Consolidation phase, the News continues to play an avid role in alleviating FUD/FOMO. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These charts show me that we&amp;#39;re in a position to shift towards Bullish Consolidation, but as Supports and Resistances are holding so firmly, this would only serve to test those levels again before reversing to a Bearish Consolidation. I see hints of Bullish Volatility and Long term Volume accumulation hiding beneath the surface, but these are not yet at a current level that could reverse or catalyze the market. It seems that we are at a crossroads and should expect continued Consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long term Support and Resistances indicate that we have reached back up to capture the Neutral zone, resting at the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001190. At MAX, we will reach back up to try to test the old faithful 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230. At LOWEST, we will reach down and test the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô until popular Indicators start showing Oversold conditions and present a Buy opportunity in a dip where the 3rd-level Support pivot point at $0.00001120 would constitute a Support BOTTOM.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they&amp;#39;re the most important to you in the world. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The petition still needs your help.

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nI find the interplay of our persistent Short Selling, being moderated by pockets of Buying Sentiment, to be fascinating. It is a true tug-of-war that unwittingly keeps market dynamics within healthy ranges. This is far from a dull Consolidation phase. \"My mission is to kill time, and time‚Äôs to kill me in its turn. How comfortable one is among murderers.\" Momentum Indicators reveal Oversold conditions, yet the activity from Short Sellers entering the market was counterbalanced by investors Buying the dips. Sellers maintain Weak control of the market across multiple time frames because profit-taking and Short Selling are occurring in tandem. Trend Indicators highlight that the price is BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, signaling a Bearish Consolidation phase. Bollinger Bands are contracting sharply, giving an early signal of breakout pressure. ADX values indicate Strong Trend strength while the price remains BELOW the Supertrend and all EMAs. This price level confirms the Bearish side of Consolidation. \n\nVolatility Indicators support the contraction of the Bollinger Bands as Volatility falls to the LOW end of our norms range. Price movements are BELOW the Volatility Bands, signaling a potential reversal benchmark. Volume Indicators continue to show participation that is slowly increasing on a daily basis as investors grab the dips and move more money into the market than out. Sentiment Indicators continue to show Strong levels of accumulation, although at a reduced rate compared to the past few days. This Short term pullback has passed Oversold conditions, and the Short term Trend cycle is emerging negative. This negative Trend cycle was Strong enough to pull the market from its Long term positive position in what I would otherwise consider a Neutral position; however, based on current values, it is technically a Weak negative Trend cycle.\n\nIn a way, I appreciate the role of Short Sellers in keeping the market active. It is like rooting for the antiheroes. Their rapid participation exerts pressure on the market in both directions, allowing for a quicker response to dips that retrace to appreciation over Short intervals. This gradual depreciation does not discourage investors. Instead, it encourages dip buying by demonstrating that the market remains active without ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô. I do not expect us to reach critical price levels of Support. In the Short term, we will continue to trade BELOW our Indicator Supports until a catalyst emerges and Buyers become more aggressive, at which point a rebound scenario would see prices closing ABOVE Indicator Resistance levels to signal the start of a recovery phase. Until that occurs, expect a continuation of the Consolidation phase.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances reveal that the price is currently resting at the TOP of the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô at the 1st-level pivot point, at $0.00001180. The critical level of Support is more clearly defined today; at LOWEST, the price could reach the BOTTOM of the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô at the 3rd-level pivot point, at $0.00001110. Just a little extra insight: should we breach our critical level, the Oversold crash price is mathematically projected to occur when the 14-Day RSI falls to 30%, at $0.00000870. BELOW this absolute worst case, the price could collapse to $0.00000350 when the 14-Day RSI reaches 20%. At MAX, the price will need to recapture the Long term Neutral major pivot point, which is now located roughly in the same position as the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW, at approximately $0.00001220 to $0.00001230.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life.

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nThere is an interesting scenario developing in the charts where the current market is testing an extended Neutral range during a Consolidation phase. Essentially, what we are seeing is that the calm before the storm remains in place. However, underneath are some intriguing market dynamics that will be covered through the various Indicator Classes. Momentum Indicators show that Neutral ground has developed. Buyers did not exit the market; instead, pressure from profit-taking increased over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, which confirms the Consolidation phase. An interesting observation is that the Bollinger Bands are roughly in the same position as they were over the past two days but are expanding at a rate of 1 value per day. This pace does not invalidate breakout potential; rather, it signals Consolidation. ADX values still show elevated Short term Trend strength. Although I classify this as a Bearish condition, it is weakening because the pressure is not Strong Sell pressure. The price has fallen BELOW the Supertrend and our Short term EMAs but remains ABOVE the 200-Day EMA, indicating a resilient yet Weak ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô.\n\nVolatility Indicators support the Bollinger Band expansion since Volatility has entered the Neutral of our norms range. Price movements continuing to stay WITHIN the Volatility Bands further confirm Consolidation. Volume Indicators highlight a small increase in participation over both the Short and Long term, while money flow is slowly increasing from Oversold levels. In fact, more money continues to steadily flow into the market than out. Sentiment Indicators reveal continuing Strong accumulation. The Trend for the Short term is emerging as a very Weak positive cycle that remains near Neutral. Despite this Consolidation, a small increase was added to the Long term positive Trend cycle, as evidenced by the increased PVT value. News articles continue to use technical analysis to highlight critical potential breakout areas and cover the rising burn rates. This increasingly Bullish Long term narrative emphasizes positive ecosystem updates and analyst projections that favor price appreciation and recovery. Despite the overwhelmingly positive coverage, these articles also present a balanced outlook by addressing Resistance levels and investor pain points as negative nuances of Volatility. Such insights help offset FUD/FOMO. \n\nOverall, these Indicators are encouraging. The main takeaway is that an external catalyst tends to drive inherently volatile markets. If an external event occurs that stimulates investor confidence in a broader context, the price will explode in appreciation from its current levels. This is especially notable given how stable the market has been and how resilient it has remained in the face of declines. I do not wish to put my foot in my mouth, but there has been a healthy underlying resiliency that is valuable in its own right. At some point, we will have to break out of this Consolidation phase, yet it is hard to tell when and in which direction we will move, given how long we have held sideways ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô. The charts show a wait-and-see phase continuing into medium time frames, meaning that the market could go in either direction based on either an external catalyst or an internal catalyst such as whale movements, which could cause either a breakout or a breakdown. Earlier, a patron remarked that ‚ÄúNothing‚Äù is happening, and that is a good way to put it because nothing appears to be happening on the surface while so much is occurring underneath.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is AT the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001210, which lies WITHIN the Neutral range between the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô and the ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô. This further supports the Consolidation outlook. At MAX, the price will attempt to follow the 4-Week retracement levels, with our first test being just below the ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230. The next level above this would be the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290. At LOWEST, the price is already near its LOWEST Support levels in the Long term, and this ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô is well defined. Falling WITHIN it is not unlikely, and doing so would likely lead to an immediate reversal because these levels are considered attractive dip prices. If I calculate this mathematically, then the LOWEST BOTTOM price before reaching a CRITICAL level would occur where the 3-Day and 14-Day raw stochastic Indicators converge at 20%, at $0.00001140.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help.

At LOWEST, the price is already near its LOWEST Support levels in the Long term, and this ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô is well defined. Falling WITHIN it is not unlikely, and doing so would likely lead to an immediate reversal because these levels are considered attractive dip prices. If I calculate this mathematically, then the LOWEST BOTTOM price before reaching a CRITICAL level would occur where the 3-Day and 14-Day raw stochastic Indicators converge at 20%, at $0.00001140.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they&amp;#39;re the most important to you in the world. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The petition still needs your help.

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nThe market held through a Consolidation phase and I will admit I was a little worried because I did not know how new investors would react. It seems that profit-taking in the Short term did not trigger a larger sell off; instead, it helped encourage some dip buying. Those who sold did so at a modest rate, leaving runners in the market and acting with the wisdom to protect their Short term capital gains. Momentum Indicators show that the Weak pull back was enough to drive the market into very Short term Oversold territory while leaving Buyers in Weak control over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is AT the HIGH Band of the Ichimoku Cloud, while Bollinger Bands hold steady with breakout pressure. ADX values confirm that the sharp Downtrend has already expressed its MAX strength, resulting in a Short term dip that was sufficient to bring the price BELOW the Supertrend and the 12-Day EMA. Despite this Short term pull back caused by profit-taking, the market remains ABOVE the Long term EMAs, verifying that ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô continues to be valid. Volatility Indicators support the ongoing outlook for breakout pressure as evidenced by the contraction of the Bollinger Bands. Volatility has declined and is holding at the LOW end of our norms range. Price movements remain WITHIN the Volatility Bands, confirming the Consolidation phase and supporting an outlook of breakout pressure. \n\nVolume Indicators signal a modest level of participation through the dips, which was an encouraging sign. Money flow indicates a Short term Oversold benchmark through the dip as increased money flows into the market compared to how much is leaving. Sentiment Indicators highlight Stronger levels of accumulation, while the CCI reflects the strength of the dip as a negative bump in a Longer term positive Trend cycle that is gaining strength, as seen by rising PVT values. News articles indicate that whales and retail investors are strategically accumulating while confirming the Bullish narrative with technical signals such as ‚ÄòGolden Crosses‚Äô and Resistance prices that set the stage for a Bullish breakout if the Support holds as expected. The Long term optimism is tempered with Short term cautions regarding Volatility due to many holders experiencing losses and a declining market ranking. However, these reports also outline a path for recovery rather than doom and gloom. As usual, the News does an excellent job of alleviating FUD/FOMO.\n\nOverall, the breakout potential has not been invalidated by the current resilient Indicator values, although they do confirm the Short term Volatility of this asset class. Given the market's resiliency and investors reaction to the pull back that led to Consolidation, the market will continue to Consolidate as a way of gauging Short term direction. It will also continue to build Buy pressure in an Uptrend cycle to test higher Resistance levels.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances show that the price remains ABOVE the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001210. The analysis confirms that the market is following the 4-Week retracement levels and is currently resting at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230, which acts as the Short term Neutral major pivot point. This is a healthy Neutral range while Buy pressure is building. At MAX, the price will reach up to test the ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô at the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290. At LOWEST, the price will pull back to test the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô at the 1st-level Support pivot point at $0.00001180.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help. Make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.\n\nPetition:\n\nhttps://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition",

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The market held through a Consolidation phase and I will admit I was a little worried because I did not know how new investors would react. It seems that profit-taking in the Short term did not trigger a larger sell off; instead, it helped encourage some dip buying. Those who sold did so at a modest rate, leaving runners in the market and acting with the wisdom to protect their Short term capital gains. Momentum Indicators show that the Weak pull back was enough to drive the market into very Short term Oversold territory while leaving Buyers in Weak control over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is AT the HIGH Band of the Ichimoku Cloud, while Bollinger Bands hold steady with breakout pressure. ADX values confirm that the sharp Downtrend has already expressed its MAX strength, resulting in a Short term dip that was sufficient to bring the price BELOW the Supertrend and the 12-Day EMA. Despite this Short term pull back caused by profit-taking, the market remains ABOVE the Long term EMAs, verifying that ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô continues to be valid. Volatility Indicators support the ongoing outlook for breakout pressure as evidenced by the contraction of the Bollinger Bands. Volatility has declined and is holding at the LOW end of our norms range. Price movements remain WITHIN the Volatility Bands, confirming the Consolidation phase and supporting an outlook of breakout pressure. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Volume Indicators signal a modest level of participation through the dips, which was an encouraging sign. Money flow indicates a Short term Oversold benchmark through the dip as increased money flows into the market compared to how much is leaving. Sentiment Indicators highlight Stronger levels of accumulation, while the CCI reflects the strength of the dip as a negative bump in a Longer term positive Trend cycle that is gaining strength, as seen by rising PVT values. News articles indicate that whales and retail investors are strategically accumulating while confirming the Bullish narrative with technical signals such as ‚ÄòGolden Crosses‚Äô and Resistance prices that set the stage for a Bullish breakout if the Support holds as expected. The Long term optimism is tempered with Short term cautions regarding Volatility due to many holders experiencing losses and a declining market ranking. However, these reports also outline a path for recovery rather than doom and gloom. As usual, the News does an excellent job of alleviating FUD/FOMO.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, the breakout potential has not been invalidated by the current resilient Indicator values, although they do confirm the Short term Volatility of this asset class. Given the market&amp;#39;s resiliency and investors reaction to the pull back that led to Consolidation, the market will continue to Consolidate as a way of gauging Short term direction. It will also continue to build Buy pressure in an Uptrend cycle to test higher Resistance levels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long term Support and Resistances show that the price remains ABOVE the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001210. The analysis confirms that the market is following the 4-Week retracement levels and is currently resting at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230, which acts as the Short term Neutral major pivot point. This is a healthy Neutral range while Buy pressure is building. At MAX, the price will reach up to test the ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô at the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290. At LOWEST, the price will pull back to test the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô at the 1st-level Support pivot point at $0.00001180.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life.

The activity is not overwhelming, which implies a healthy level of stability in the current market. Momentum Indicators reveal that Buy pressure has strengthened in the Short term, reaching an Overbought benchmark. Buyers hold an Average level of control over the market across multiple time frames. Trend Indicators show that price movements are hovering near the HIGH Band of the Ichimoku Cloud while still remaining WITHIN it, which indicates Bullish Consolidation. Bollinger Bands are contracting even further, implying that despite the market being Overbought, breakout pressure is building. The price is positioned ABOVE our Supertrend and all EMAs, while the Short term EMAs are rising ABOVE the Long term EMAs. This suggests a Strong level of ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô. Volatility Indicators support the contraction of the Bollinger Bands as Volatility has declined to the LOW end of our norms range. Price movements are building near the HIGH Volatility Bands, supporting an outlook of Bullish Consolidation that is building toward a breakout.\n\nVolume Indicators reveal reduced investor participation in both the Short and Long term, as if indicating a calm before the storm. Despite this reduced participation, current money flow shows more money moving into the market, which lends strength to the stable Uptrend during Consolidation. The market remains in a Long term Weak Bearish Neutral position, with plenty of room before conditions become truly Overbought or Oversold. Sentiment Indicators highlight Strong levels of accumulation with additional strength building toward an emerging positive Trend cycle. However, underlying profit-taking forces the market to persist through a Long term negative Trend cycle, as evidenced by declining PVT values. News articles offer a Long term Bullish bias with narratives based on technical analysis that confirm Support and Resistance levels as predictors of price appreciation. Additional positive insights regarding ecosystem developments and updates from developers further illustrate the utilization narrative. Although Short term cautions about Volatility persist, the articles continue to alleviate FUD/FOMO.\n\nDue to the inherent stability observed in the Indicators and the growing positive bias among institutional investors, the Short term price dynamic would be to continue a Bullish Consolidation while building to a point that may trigger a Volatile breakout. Some caution remains, but overall the Indicators and general Sentiment imply continued Uptrend.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances show that we are currently resting AT our Short term Neutral major pivot point, which is just ABOVE the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230. This position falls WITHIN the Neutral range ABOVE the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001210, confirming Bullish Consolidation. At MAX, the price will follow the 4-Week retracement path and test the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290 as a way to test the ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô. If investor confidence increases, the breakout would extend further, reaching the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001360. This would extend the range from the very Short term into the Mid term. At LOWEST, the price will pull back and then bounce off the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô. The mathematically critical price level is at $0.00001140, where the 3-Day and 14-Day raw stochastic Indicators converge at 20%.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life.

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nAs positive Buy energy picks up, the market environment demonstrates the stability needed to nurture Long term recovery within a tight trading range that appears as Consolidations through Short spans. Momentum Indicators signal that Buyers are contending with Sell pressure in the form of profit-taking, which leads to a Weak Bullish rate of change over multiple time frames. Buyers currently hold Average levels of control over the market with plenty of room before reaching Overbought conditions.Trend Indicators show that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud while Bollinger Bands are beginning to contract again, implying a building breakout potential for the market. ADX values confirm Average Trend strength while the price remains ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs, highlighting active ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô throughout the current market. Volatility Indicators support the contraction of the Bollinger Bands as Volatility falls to the Neutral of our norms range. Volatility Bands show that price movements are near the HIGH Bands and are attempting to break ABOVE, which supports an outlook of appreciation.\n\nVolume Indicators clarify the Buyers' struggle against Seller outflows resulting from profit-taking by revealing reduced levels of Short and Long term participation. Although there is stable Sell pressure from profit-taking, more money has begun flowing into the market than out. Sentiment Indicators highlight the continued strengthening of the emerging positive Trend cycle with Strong levels of accumulation that have weakened the PVT value and nearly neutralized the Long term negative Trend cycle. This can be considered roughly a Neutral ground. News articles offered a renewed Bullish, Long term narrative for the ecosystem by highlighting the anticipation of upcoming upgrades. This positive narrative shift implies that institutional recognition of Shiba Inu is evolving from a mere MEME to a broader ecosystem of utility. Articles highlight the same Short term Volatility struggles using technical analysis, yet overall they continue to alleviate FUD/FOMO. \n\nI am reminded of the ‚ÄòGroup A/Group B‚Äô analogy that I have referred to in the past, as incoming investors are not as accustomed to the current price levels and market behavior. It is with this underlying potential Volatility that I expect the market to continue its Bullish Trend in order to test higher resistance prices before undergoing a minor Consolidation of gains. The breakout potential is building, but even more importantly, there is a broader need for stability and recovery. I implore whale investors to take it lightly on incoming Buyers because their psychology will require stability; otherwise, you risk triggering the emotional side of that ‚ÄòGroup B‚Äô, which can result in an immediate Strong pullback from which their conservative/safe investors may never return.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances show that the price is resting just BELOW the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW, which serves as the Short term Neutral major pivot point, at $0.00001230. At MAX, the price will follow this retracement path to test the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001360. At LOWEST, the price will test the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô, beginning at the 1st-level pivot point at $0.00001140. Falling to the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô would not be significant, but falling BELOW the entire ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô, specifically BELOW the 3rd standard price deviation at $0.00001060, would classify as a critical point.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help.

Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.\n\nPetition:\n\nhttps://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition",

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nIt appears that we Consolidated just as expected within a healthy Neutral range as the market continues to pick up Buy pressure in the Short term. Momentum Indicators show that Buyers are emerging and exerting strength, leading to a Neutral ground with Buyers establishing control of the market across multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, while Bollinger Bands continue to expand, confirming a Consolidation phase. ADX values show Average Trend strength while the price remains ABOVE our Supertrend and AT our Short term EMAs, all while attempting to revitalize ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô. Volatility Indicators support the expansion of the Bollinger Bands with rising Volatility toward the HIGH end of our norms range. Price movements remain WITHIN the Volatility Bands, which supports the extended Consolidation phase. Volume Indicators highlight decreased participation, signaling a wait-and-see phase among investors as they gauge the market's next direction. Money flow has turned Neutral with plenty of room in either direction, depending on what investors decide in the Short term.\n\nSentiment Indicators signal a reversal in the market as a new emerging positive Trend cycle demonstrates Strong levels of accumulation. This renewed level of participation has nearly neutralized the Long term negative Trend cycle, but there is still some ground to recover. News articles offer renewed Bullish bias for Long term potential, featuring reports on resilient technical Support levels, ecosystem milestones and upgrades, and whale accumulation. Despite the renewed Bullish narrative, the articles still address Short term struggles such as a HIGH percentage of holders experiencing losses, reduced token burn rates, and a test of the 13-Month LOW. These reports address the realistic Short term Volatility struggles of this asset class while also encouraging investors and continuing to alleviate FUD/FOMO.\n\nFrom what I can tell, the market in a broader context is attempting to stabilize. Typically, we would expect the dynamic to follow a narrow trading range in the Short term as investors build confidence and comfort while deciding what direction to take the market next. Underlying this are some Bullish impulses, but otherwise the market will likely look to establish some Neutral ground.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances reveal that the price is resting just ABOVE the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001150. At MAX, we will follow the 4-Week retracements and test the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230. At LOWEST, we will slip down and test the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô near the midway level at the 1st level Support pivot point at $0.00001090.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help. Make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.\n\nPetition:\n\nhttps://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition",

Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nOur expectation was for an external catalyst to invigorate the market, and that is exactly what we witnessed. Momentum Indicators show that Buyers stepped in during the very Short term, leading to a Bullish rate of change that contested Seller control across multiple time frames and resulted in only Weak Seller dominance. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, bouncing off the HIGH Band, while Bollinger Bands expand to signal an upcoming phase of Consolidation. The ADX values show Strong Trend strength, with the price positioned ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs, indicating that the current market is active with ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô. Volatility Indicators support the Consolidation phase as Volatility approaches the Neutral of our norms range. Volatility Bands provide a breakout signal, which aligns with a Bullish Consolidation outlook. Volume Indicators continue to signal active market participation throughout these phases, with a neutralized Short term money flow while opening substantial room for price movements before reaching Overbought levels.\n\nSentiment Indicators highlight Strong levels of distribution, although these are considerably weaker compared to our previous averages. Despite aggressive investors returning to the market, the emerging positive Trend cycle is weak when compared to the strength in the Long term negative Trend cycle as shown by PVT values. News articles have been increasingly active in presenting a realistic view of the market by emphasizing whale participation and token burns as the main narrative. With such a realistic perspective on Shiba Inu price movements, the Long term narrative remains Bullish while still cautioning against Short term Volatility. This realistic view serves to alleviate FUD/FOMO among investors.\n\nWe are following expected market dynamics based on measurable technical indicators, but there is an external factor we must contend with. These latest price movements show that despite our best efforts, the market is controlled by players much larger than ourselves. I believe that a phase of wait-and-see will lead to a Consolidation of gains in the Short term before Buy pressure intensifies enough to test Resistance prices and establish higher Neutral zones.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is WITHIN the ‚ÄôWall of Resistance‚Äô, currently resting just BELOW the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230. This position acts as the Short term Neutral major pivot point. At MAX, the price will follow the 4-Week retracement levels to test the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001360. At LOWEST, the price will retreat back to the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001100.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help.

Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.\n\nPetition:\n\nhttps://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition",

Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nResiliency continues with signs of dip buying from aggressive whale investors, which is helping to hold the market at what appears to be a Short term Neutral ground. Momentum Indicators confirm that the price is in Neutral territory, with dip buying smoothing the rate of change across multiple time frames and weakening the outright control of Sellers in the market. Trend Indicators show that the price is BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, while Bollinger Bands are beginning to contract and reveal early signs of breakout potential. ADX values highlight Average Trend strength as the price hovers near the Supertrend but remains BELOW all EMAs. Volatility Indicators reveal an increase in Volatility, supporting the contraction of the Bollinger Bands. Volatility Bands confirm that the price is in Oversold territory, which further supports the potential for a breakout. Volume Indicators continue to signal market participation from Buyers in the dips over both the Short and Long term, leading to a neutralized Short term flow, although more money continues to flow out of the market than in over the Long term. \n\nSentiment Indicators suggest that this may have been the bottom of capitulation, with Strong distribution approaching some of the highest values seen in a while. Despite the extreme Sell pressure throughout the market, the weight of Seller control only added slight strength to the very Short term negative Trend cycle, while aggressive whale participation during the dips helped to weaken the Long term negative Trend cycle. News articles have begun to cover the Long term Bullish potential of the market by highlighting technical breakouts, on-chain metrics, and burn rates as signs of positive developments, recovery, and expected price surges. Despite the increase in positive narratives, there remain cautions about Short term Volatility stemming from the significant market pain investors are experiencing during this period of panic. These articles are highly accurate and do well to alleviate FUD/FOMO for investors entering the market.\n\nAll of these signals combine to paint a picture of a prevailing Bearish Trend running sideways through Consolidation, as the market attempts to find stable footing, gather positive Sentiment, and increase participation while waiting for an external catalyst. It is this resiliency that leads me to expect the Consolidation phase to continue while the market tests Support and Resistance benchmarks.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances reveal that we are resting in the Neutral zone just BELOW the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001140, which is positioned ABOVE the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô. At LOWEST, the price will test the critical psychological Support level at $0.00001000. Falling BELOW this price would mean that the market could mathematically reach a BOTTOM where the 14-Day RSI is at 20%, near $0.00000690. At MAX, the price will attempt to follow the 4-Week retracement levels, with the first test being the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help. Make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.\n\nPetition:\n\nhttps://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition",

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nIt appears that nearly every sector I analyze is experiencing an equal share of Downtrend pressure today. Shiba Inu fared well, as we are roughly in the same position as yesterday. Momentum Indicators show capitulation; however, aggressive dip buying helped smooth the negative rate of change, giving Sellers only Average control across multiple time frames. Trend Indicators show that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud while Bollinger Bands expanded sharply, confirming a Consolidation phase. ADX values highlight Average Trend strength as the price remains AT or BELOW the Supertrend and Short term EMAs, yet it still lags behind longer averages, highlighting continued Short term struggles. Volatility Indicators support the Consolidation phase as Volatility appears to be reversing toward the HIGH end of the norms range, while price movements stabilize WITHIN the Volatility Bands to reinforce the Consolidation outlook. Volume Indicators were showing surprising signs of market participation from our aggressive whale investors, who continued their dip buying at an impressive pace despite rising outflows from deep Oversold territory as more money moved out of the market than in. \n\nSentiment Indicators reveal some influence from these aggressive investors while also showing that Strong distribution levels remain, although sharply decreased from previous averages. This suggests that the aggressive dip buyers have prevented the market from reaching the LOWEST prices factored by my algorithm. Despite active market participation, the capitulation led to the reinforcement and establishment of a negative Trend cycle in both the Short and Long term. News followed the Trend of capitulation and began focusing on the Short term struggles of the market. Overall, the coverage carried a Bearish tone that cannot be ignored; it would be inappropriate to dissuade investors from acknowledging the challenging conditions they are now experiencing. While there are positive projections and highlights regarding burns and ecosystem upgrades, the narrative remains negative yet realistic, tempering FUD/FOMO while outlining the current market state for incoming investors.\n\nCombining all these insights, it seems that resiliency remains in the Long term prospects for gains, not only for Shiba Inu but across many sectors. This capitulation is being felt as a shared experience that is acting like an external catalyst. Should such catalysts turn positive or even Neutral, the turnaround and potential for gains will grow stronger relative to the depth of price depreciation. In the Short term, diligence regarding your portfolio remains in your own hands. I expect a phase of wait-and-see Consolidation as everyone attempts to determine what the f*** just happened, assess the damage of the Downtrend, and decide whether participation falls within their risk tolerances. It is truly the calm before the storm.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances reveal that we are resting in a stall range that is becoming familiar, marked by the crossover of the 3-Day and 10-Day moving averages at $0.00001140 WITHIN the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô. At LOWEST, we will retest the 52-Week LOW at $0.00001030. $0.00001000 acts as a major psychological Support level. Falling BELOW this level would be BOTTOMED when the 14-Day RSI reaches 20% at roughly $0.00000660. At MAX, the price will attempt to follow retracements of the 4-Week levels; in the Short term, the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230 will act as a Neutral major pivot point, resting just ABOVE the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001220, with that range serving as a Neutral stall Band.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help. Make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.\n\nPetition:\n\nhttps://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition",

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It appears that nearly every sector I analyze is experiencing an equal share of Downtrend pressure today. Shiba Inu fared well, as we are roughly in the same position as yesterday. Momentum Indicators show capitulation; however, aggressive dip buying helped smooth the negative rate of change, giving Sellers only Average control across multiple time frames. Trend Indicators show that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud while Bollinger Bands expanded sharply, confirming a Consolidation phase. ADX values highlight Average Trend strength as the price remains AT or BELOW the Supertrend and Short term EMAs, yet it still lags behind longer averages, highlighting continued Short term struggles. Volatility Indicators support the Consolidation phase as Volatility appears to be reversing toward the HIGH end of the norms range, while price movements stabilize WITHIN the Volatility Bands to reinforce the Consolidation outlook. Volume Indicators were showing surprising signs of market participation from our aggressive whale investors, who continued their dip buying at an impressive pace despite rising outflows from deep Oversold territory as more money moved out of the market than in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sentiment Indicators reveal some influence from these aggressive investors while also showing that Strong distribution levels remain, although sharply decreased from previous averages. This suggests that the aggressive dip buyers have prevented the market from reaching the LOWEST prices factored by my algorithm. Despite active market participation, the capitulation led to the reinforcement and establishment of a negative Trend cycle in both the Short and Long term. News followed the Trend of capitulation and began focusing on the Short term struggles of the market. Overall, the coverage carried a Bearish tone that cannot be ignored; it would be inappropriate to dissuade investors from acknowledging the challenging conditions they are now experiencing. While there are positive projections and highlights regarding burns and ecosystem upgrades, the narrative remains negative yet realistic, tempering FUD/FOMO while outlining the current market state for incoming investors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Combining all these insights, it seems that resiliency remains in the Long term prospects for gains, not only for Shiba Inu but across many sectors. This capitulation is being felt as a shared experience that is acting like an external catalyst. Should such catalysts turn positive or even Neutral, the turnaround and potential for gains will grow stronger relative to the depth of price depreciation. In the Short term, diligence regarding your portfolio remains in your own hands. I expect a phase of wait-and-see Consolidation as everyone attempts to determine what the f*** just happened, assess the damage of the Downtrend, and decide whether participation falls within their risk tolerances. It is truly the calm before the storm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long term Support and Resistances reveal that we are resting in a stall range that is becoming familiar, marked by the crossover of the 3-Day and 10-Day moving averages at $0.00001140 WITHIN the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô. At LOWEST, we will retest the 52-Week LOW at $0.00001030. $0.00001000 acts as a major psychological Support level. Falling BELOW this level would be BOTTOMED when the 14-Day RSI reaches 20% at roughly $0.00000660. At MAX, the price will attempt to follow retracements of the 4-Week levels; in the Short term, the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230 will act as a Neutral major pivot point, resting just ABOVE the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001220, with that range serving as a Neutral stall Band.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they&amp;#39;re the most important to you in the world. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The petition still needs your help.
