I thought it best to share this news with my immediate family first. Mainly, I wouldn't want to hurt any of their feelings, after all, Sentiment is King.\n\nIt is my deepest pleasure to share with all of you that I have invested in my family alongside my wife. My wife and I have confirmed with the doctor that she is 16 weeks pregnant, and I will soon become a father for our 2nd child. This is the greatest investment I could ever make. Some men want fame, some want power, some want wealth... I want to be a father. This is the greatest journey, and I cannot begin to put into words the amount of joy I feel in my heart. We already have my daughter set aside some SHIB, and now I get to add one more to the SHIBArmy very soon.\n\nGood afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nThere are encouraging signs in the charts today as the market moved through Consolidation, as expected. Momentum Indicators show that Buyers are slowly increasing pressure over the current Trend, leading to a weakening of Seller control across multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud but has begun to rise WITHIN the Cloud, suggesting early signs of Bullish Consolidation. Bollinger Bands have contracted even further, a Strong signal of a market squeeze that supports Bullish Consolidation and hints at breakout pressure. Meanwhile, the price remains BELOW the Supertrend and all EMAs, indicating that ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô remains elusive but within reach.\n\nVolatility Indicators signal that Volatility has declined to the LOW end of our norms range, meaning that price movements are expected to trade within a very narrow range. Volatility Bands confirm that the price is beginning to elevate ABOVE the LOW Bands, supporting an outlook of Short term stability. Volume Indicators show increased Buys, implying Long term investor confidence; however, the market remains in Long term Oversold territory. Fortunately, the outflow of capital is beginning to weaken due to renewed participation from Long term investors in the dips.\n\nSentiment Indicators continue to highlight Strong distribution and an underlying Short term negative Trend cycle, though this pressure is weakening as early Buyers step into the dips. This renewed participation has reinvigorated the positive PVT Trend cycle, preventing it from being utterly invalidated. News articles provided substantially less coverage compared to this previous week, yet they retain a Long term Bullish bias, citing massive ‚Äòx‚Äô fold surges, potential institutional injection from BlackRock, and Strong technical and fundamental data surrounding our burn rate and growing Shibarium TVL. While these insights bolster a Bullish outlook, articles also highlight Short term risks and Volatility concerns, with overall coverage remaining balanced and implying Bullish influence for investors entering the market.\n\nVarious Indicators across multiple time frames suggest that our market is nearing Long term Support prices. In the very Short term, we should expect a bounce of accumulation following a Consolidation phase. Given the Bollinger Bands squeeze, the typical dynamic would be a breakout; however, due to prevailing external market conditions, any breakout may be localized or short-lived, resulting in Neutral ground just BELOW Long term Resistance prices. \n\nLong term Support and Resistances indicate that we are resting just BELOW the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW, which is acting as the Short term, Neutral major pivot point. At MAX, the market will build pressure to reach our next 4-Week retracement test at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001380. At LOWEST, the price will again fall back to that convergence of the 3-Day and 14-Day raw stochastic indicators reaching 30% at $0.00001230. An interesting note about this price level is that it aligns on larger time scale charts to form a Long term Support level, where the market tends to make major moves when near the $0.00001230 - $0.00001340 range.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help. Make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.\n\nPetition:\n\nhttps://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition",

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nSome good news is that the market is right where we expected it, within range, which means we are still operating within expected dynamics. I really wanted to examine the early part of the global noon session to gain insights into some of the initial market participants for the day, allowing me to gauge my algorithm‚Äôs price range. At least we can confirm that we have a pure and accurate view.\n\nMomentum Indicators show some Bullish potential underlying the market. Though, while there may be some Short bounces if Buyers step forward, the prevailing force indicates that Sellers are in control, applying Strong Downtrend pressure across multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, the Supertrend, and all EMAs, coupled with Weak Short term Trend strength but a lingering, Strong Bearish Long term strength. This confirms the pressure of the Downtrend, almost as if the market is urging us to step back and view it from a distance. So, as we zoom in, the Short term picture becomes clearer, where the Bearish pressure is weakening and currently shows LOW strength. I point that out because the Bollinger Bands have contracted even further today.\n\nVolatility Indicators align with this contraction, showing that Volatility has entered the Neutral range of our norms. This means that any price movement will be constrained to a narrow range until Momentum pushes a breakout. Volatility Bands confirm that the market remains Oversold, while other Indicators point to early signs of building breakout potential. Volume Indicators reveal a mixed picture of inflows highlighting accumulation during the Downtrend, implying Long term confidence and dip buying. On the other hand, the MFI indicates increased Oversold conditions, with more money still flowing out than in, even though that outflow has been cut in half by dip buying. This supports the early breakout pressure building, as indicated by our Trend and Volatility classes. \n\nSentiment Indicators continue to show Strong distribution, yet CCI reveals that the pressure feeding this emerging negative Trend cycle is weakening. Unfortunately, as I was considering the PVT, over time it has become a bit like Punxsutawney predicting Spring; the PVT has retreated back into the negative Trend cycle. News articles continue to emphasize a Strong Long term commitment by highlighting the token burns and what appears to be an effort to suggest solid fundamentals for SHIB‚Äôs future. Although there were Bearish articles, they served to offset FUD/FOMO by drawing attention to certain technical risks and Short term Volatility, especially in April based on historical patterns. Overall, the News paints a stable but cautious picture for investors.\n\nThere are plenty of encouraging signs throughout the market, as Indicators remain within the expected parameters based on my algorithm‚Äôs price range. I see the build-up potential for a corrective rebound;  though, since the prevailing Trend remains Bullish, the most likely scenario is Consolidation, which carries an inherent risk of reverting to a Downtrend if broader Volume and Sentiment Indicators do not improve. The Indicators highlight a tug-of-war between Long term Buyers and Short term Sellers, and it is this inherent market participation that, in my view, offsets the current downbeat state. Focusing once again on the very Short term, the market needs to Consolidate and move sideways for a little while as investors gauge the next Trend direction. Based on the ATR, this should result in a stable, tight range of price movements until either an external catalyst emerges or the commonly watched Indicators start showing entry signals. \n\nLong term Support  and Resistances confirm the market‚Äôs tendency to follow Fibonacci retracement levels based on 4-Week price movements. We currently rest at the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW at $0.00001270, a level that will be considered our Neutral major pivot point for the very Short term. At MAX, the price will attempt to recapture the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001340, representing the market‚Äôs effort to Consolidate and find Neutral ground. At LOWEST, we are roughly at what I would consider the BOTTOM for the current market. However, given that increased outflows could follow a Consolidation, the convergence of the 3-Day raw stochastic reaching 30% and the 14-Day raw stochastic also reaching 30% at $0.00001230 would be the signal that the Long term market is truly Oversold.\n\nAn additional side note is that I needed to get around today extra early also because I will be sharing the news of an amazing investment I have been able to undertake with my immediate family. I will share the details tomorrow in a pre-statement that I will add to my analysis. I am extremely excited to undertake this opportunity in my life and look forward to sharing with all of you.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help. Make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.\n\nPetition:\n\nhttps://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition",

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nThe alignment of external pressures during an existing Consolidation phase came at the wrong time. My algorithm shows that the price potential really expanded due to the rapid pace of depreciation in the Short term. \n\nMomentum Indicators reveal- that the price continues to hold in Oversold territory, while Sellers have taken control of the market, applying Bearish pressure across multiple time frames. Trend Indicators show that the price has fallen BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, signaling a period of Bearish Consolidation. Bollinger Bands have contracted even further, signaling that breakout pressure still exists and is building. ADX values in the Short term confirm that the Downtrend pressure maintained Oversold conditions and retained Strong Trend strength rather than letting off the pedal. The price is BELOW the Supertrend and all EMAs, indicating that we are fresh out of ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô. Volatility Indicators show declining Volatility, approaching the Neutral range of our norms, and Volatility Bands confirm deep Oversold conditions. Volume Indicators do show some investor optimism, with Strong signs of dip buying. Though, against the Strong Downtrend pressure, more money continues to flow out of the market than in. MFI reveals that the current market is in deep Oversold territory. Sentiment Indicators reveal Strong distribution and a sharp increase, establishing a Strong negative Trend cycle. Despite the sharp decline, investors were able to maintain a positive PVT Trend cycle in the Long term thanks to dip buying. News articles continue to be Bullish, with Long term pieces highlighting the continuing burns, updates about the Shiba Inu development team, and positive technical patterns. Although coverage has been reduced, signaling that News is in a wait-and-see phase, it remains diligent to monitor Short term Volatility by tracking whale movements. They are doing their best to mitigate a flare-up in FUD/FOMO. \n\nWith so many of the Indicators I follow across multiple sectors showing a reaction to external catalysts, such as tariffs and economic projections/results, there seems to be a developing phase of caution among investors. This makes it hard to predict which direction they will take, but I have been doing research on archetypal reactions in different economic situations. With that in mind, investors are showing resiliency at both retail and institutional levels. Despite what seems to be a general pullback, I don't see this as an erosion of investor confidence. Focusing on the very Short term, we will need to Consolidate the Downtrend. So, for now, let's anticipate this Consolidation phase to head to Neutral ground. At this same time, others and myself will utilize common Indicators to gauge reentry or recovery according to risk tolerances. I'm not sure when recovery will occur, but we've all seen that when economic news is positive, it generates an external catalyst that drives general value across many sectors. This is exactly that moment I recall that Warren Buffett spoke of where we are witnessing the increase in fear. To be a great investor, in my opinion, we all must learn to balance fear with greed. I would recommend that each of you apply personal due diligence and consider the positive factors across many sectors. It is my strongest recommendation that now is the time to grab the low prices and dollar-cost average (DCA) as much as possible. \n\nTurning to our Long term Support and Resistances, they reveal that the market has fallen into the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô and is retracing our 4-Week HIGH and LOW levels. At MAX, the price will follow this general retracement of the 4-Week levels, where a 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001380 is anticipated to be the next Short term Neutral Support level. At LOWEST, I feel that this same 4-Week level of retracement is crucial, and the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW at $0.00001270 represents bottom dollar.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help. Make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.\n\nPetition:\n\nhttps://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition",

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nIt is clear that the market has now entered the expected Consolidation phase, as highlighted by several Indicator classes in my charts. Momentum Indicators reveal that Buyers have shifted into a wait‚Äëand‚Äësee mode, with profit-taking in the Short term leading to a Consolidation of gains. Although the market has approached Oversold levels, Buyers continue to maintain Weak control, as shown by the KST values across multiple time frames. Trend Indicators show that prices have slipped into the Ichimoku Cloud, confirming Consolidation. Meanwhile, Bollinger Bands are beginning to contract, a signal that breakout pressure is starting to build. The current ADX value reveals Strong Short term Trend strength, suggesting that the Oversold pressure is beginning to ease and the Neutral ground is forming. Though the price is now BELOW our Supertrend and Short term EMAs, it still remains ABOVE the 200‚ÄëDay, which is an encouraging sign of sustained ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô.\n\nVolatility Indicators show that Volatility has increased, approaching the HIGH end of our norms range. Price movements are bouncing off the LOW Volatility Bands, confirming that the market is Consolidating rather than breaking down. Volume Indicators point to a general pullback, consistent with profit-taking as investors assess the current Trend. The MFI reinforces that we are in Oversold territory, and the Short term Downtrend is moving more money out of the market than in.\n\nSentiment Indicators present a mixed picture. Strong distribution has developed a Short term negative Trend cycle, but when viewed against the Long term, the positive PVT Trend cycle remains intact. News articles have been especially Bullish today, citing increased burn rates, anticipated ecosystem upgrades, DeFi and ETF initiatives, and enhanced whale activity. While a few articles have warned about Short term Volatility and leadership uncertainties, the overall narrative remains Bullish for both investor psychology and institutional Sentiment.\n\nAll of these signals suggest that the market is in an exceptionally healthy Consolidation phase. As expected, we pulled back into Oversold territory and Volume has started to stabilize. In the Short term, a downside is possible, but thanks to the underlying shift in Sentiment, the market will likely run sideways for a bit before Buy pressure builds enough to try to test the higher Resistance prices, nearer to the end of day Friday.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is now in the Neutral zone, resting just BELOW the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001460. The market is trading within a defined stall range that allows the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô and ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô to become more defined. At MAX, the price will build pressure and move ABOVE this stall zone at the crossover of the 3‚ÄëDay over the 10‚ÄëDay moving average at $0.00001500. This will trigger a bounce off the BOTTOM of the ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô. At LOWEST, the price will pull back to test the 38.2% retracement of the 4‚ÄëWeek HIGH at $0.00001380, bouncing off the TOP of the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help.

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nWow, that was an impressive Uptrend cycle. Bullish signals came through nearly every technical Indicator in my charts. Momentum Indicators show that Buyers are increasing Bullish pressure in the Short term, creating a bubble of FOMO across multiple time frames. Though, some values are also revealing Overbought. Trend Indicators show that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud while Bollinger Bands are starting to expand. The Strong Short term ADX value confirms Trend strength is providing an early signal of impending Consolidation as the market is Overbought. The price continues to hold ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs, highlighting active ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô despite some pullbacks.\n\nVolatility Indicators support an Overbought Consolidation scenario, with Volatility increasing toward the HIGH end of our norms range. Price movements pushing into our HIGH Volatility Bands acts as confirmation that the market is Overbought. Volume Indicators, also, show early signs of Overbought conditions, as Sell pressure from profit-taking is beginning to mount against the current Trend, even though MFI values still indicate stable Buy pressure with more money flowing into the market than out.\n\nSentiment Indicators reveal Strong accumulation, reinforcing the new positive Trend cycle. We've finally reversed the Long term negative PVT Trend cycle, establishing a resilient new Trend. Even if a pullback occurs, our Long term position remains very Strong. News articles have been echoing these technical signals. They covered increased burn rates and ecosystem upgrades while also highlighting the new institutional excitement around our DEX utilization and the upcoming SHIB Finance. Although some articles caution about Short term Volatility, overall the News is pushing a Bullish Long term narrative. Institutional awareness is piquing, which bodes well for the psychology of investors entering the market.\n\nFocusing on the Short term, there are clear expectations for a Consolidation of gains. Whether this Consolidation takes the form of a Strong pullback to test Support or a Bullish Consolidation with stable price appreciation is still uncertain but all Indicators point to an emerging Bullish market. As one of my mentors always says, \"Don't bet against the Trend.\" Right now, Sentiment is KING, and we will continue on this positive path until a significant catalyst prompts a reassessment.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances show that the price is resting within the ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô, just BELOW the anticipated stall range where the 3-Day moving average crosses over the 10-Day moving average at $0.00001440. At MAX, the price will build Uptrend pressure to create a new Neutral Support range, reaching up to the 38.2% retracement of our 13-Week LOW at $0.00001620. At LOWEST, the market could pull back and test our Neutral range near the TOP of the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô at the 1st-level Support pivot point, at $0.00001360.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help. Make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.\n\nPetition:\n\nhttps://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition",

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wow, that was an impressive Uptrend cycle. Bullish signals came through nearly every technical Indicator in my charts. Momentum Indicators show that Buyers are increasing Bullish pressure in the Short term, creating a bubble of FOMO across multiple time frames. Though, some values are also revealing Overbought. Trend Indicators show that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud while Bollinger Bands are starting to expand. The Strong Short term ADX value confirms Trend strength is providing an early signal of impending Consolidation as the market is Overbought. The price continues to hold ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs, highlighting active ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô despite some pullbacks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Volatility Indicators support an Overbought Consolidation scenario, with Volatility increasing toward the HIGH end of our norms range. Price movements pushing into our HIGH Volatility Bands acts as confirmation that the market is Overbought. Volume Indicators, also, show early signs of Overbought conditions, as Sell pressure from profit-taking is beginning to mount against the current Trend, even though MFI values still indicate stable Buy pressure with more money flowing into the market than out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sentiment Indicators reveal Strong accumulation, reinforcing the new positive Trend cycle. We&amp;#39;ve finally reversed the Long term negative PVT Trend cycle, establishing a resilient new Trend. Even if a pullback occurs, our Long term position remains very Strong. News articles have been echoing these technical signals. They covered increased burn rates and ecosystem upgrades while also highlighting the new institutional excitement around our DEX utilization and the upcoming SHIB Finance. Although some articles caution about Short term Volatility, overall the News is pushing a Bullish Long term narrative. Institutional awareness is piquing, which bodes well for the psychology of investors entering the market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Focusing on the Short term, there are clear expectations for a Consolidation of gains. Whether this Consolidation takes the form of a Strong pullback to test Support or a Bullish Consolidation with stable price appreciation is still uncertain but all Indicators point to an emerging Bullish market. As one of my mentors always says, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t bet against the Trend.&amp;quot; Right now, Sentiment is KING, and we will continue on this positive path until a significant catalyst prompts a reassessment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long term Support and Resistances show that the price is resting within the ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô, just BELOW the anticipated stall range where the 3-Day moving average crosses over the 10-Day moving average at $0.00001440. At MAX, the price will build Uptrend pressure to create a new Neutral Support range, reaching up to the 38.2% retracement of our 13-Week LOW at $0.00001620. At LOWEST, the market could pull back and test our Neutral range near the TOP of the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô at the 1st-level Support pivot point, at $0.00001360.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they&amp;#39;re the most important to you in the world. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The petition still needs your help. Make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Petition:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition\"&gt;https://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nIt is such a pleasure to see a continuing Uptrend in the market, especially when you consider that, fundamentally, Shiba Inu and many other cryptocurrencies represent solid companies. If you were to look inside, you‚Äôd find robust growth values across all sectors of their businesses and development teams. Unfortunately, this quality is not always reflected in a market so heavily driven by Sentiment.\n\nMomentum Indicators show that Buyers are maintaining Long term confidence, with the KST revealing that Buy pressure is increasing across multiple time frames. Trend Indicators confirm that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud while Bollinger Bands fluctuate. An Average Short term ADX value shows stable Trend strength. The price holding ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs reveals that the market is currently driven by active ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô.\n\nVolatility Indicators show rising Volatility, though still near the Neutral of our norms range. Price movements are riding near the HIGH Volatility Bands, hinting at breakout pressure building for another Uptrend cycle. Volume Indicators do show some pullback, as Buy Volume is beginning to weaken. However, the MFI is hovering in the Neutral range and the CMF continues to show that more money flows into the market than out. This suggests that some of our more conservative investors are in a wait-and-see phase while aggressive investors are actively accumulating.\n\nSentiment Indicators further confirm Strong accumulation, with current Buyer activity strengthening the emerging positive Trend cycle. The cherry on top is that investor resiliency has nearly neutralized the Long term negative PVT Trend cycle of the previous Downtrend, bringing us close to a Long term Neutral state. News Sentiment continues with a Bullish bias driven by the potential ETF launch, increased burn rate, and L3 upgrades for the ecosystem. Although a few articles have highlighted Short term Volatility risks, overall the News is pushing for a Long term appreciation narrative.\n\nGiven the market‚Äôs position and the underlying resiliency of our aggressive investors, the market appears poised to continue appreciating and test Resistance prices, with short Consolidations along the way. On the other hand, if aggressive investors pull back to align with more conservative participants, that could trigger a Bearish Consolidation phase that would test the LOW Volatility Bands.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances reveal that we are now sitting at our next anticipated Short term Neutral major pivot point. This point aligns with the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH, which, as well, aligns with the 3rd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001360. At MAX, I expect the price to build pressure and test the ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô, where I see us entering a stall range as the 9-Day moving average crosses over the 18-Day moving average at $0.00001420. Additionally, around this point the 3-Day moving average crosses over the 10-Day moving average, just ABOVE $0.00001430. These convergences create a solid Resistance test for the Short term. At LOWEST, the price is going to bounce off the TOP of the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äù at the 1st standard price deviation at $0.00001310.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help.

Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.\n\nPetition:\n\nhttps://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition",

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is such a pleasure to see a continuing Uptrend in the market, especially when you consider that, fundamentally, Shiba Inu and many other cryptocurrencies represent solid companies. If you were to look inside, you‚Äôd find robust growth values across all sectors of their businesses and development teams. Unfortunately, this quality is not always reflected in a market so heavily driven by Sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Momentum Indicators show that Buyers are maintaining Long term confidence, with the KST revealing that Buy pressure is increasing across multiple time frames. Trend Indicators confirm that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud while Bollinger Bands fluctuate. An Average Short term ADX value shows stable Trend strength. The price holding ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs reveals that the market is currently driven by active ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Volatility Indicators show rising Volatility, though still near the Neutral of our norms range. Price movements are riding near the HIGH Volatility Bands, hinting at breakout pressure building for another Uptrend cycle. Volume Indicators do show some pullback, as Buy Volume is beginning to weaken. However, the MFI is hovering in the Neutral range and the CMF continues to show that more money flows into the market than out. This suggests that some of our more conservative investors are in a wait-and-see phase while aggressive investors are actively accumulating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sentiment Indicators further confirm Strong accumulation, with current Buyer activity strengthening the emerging positive Trend cycle. The cherry on top is that investor resiliency has nearly neutralized the Long term negative PVT Trend cycle of the previous Downtrend, bringing us close to a Long term Neutral state. News Sentiment continues with a Bullish bias driven by the potential ETF launch, increased burn rate, and L3 upgrades for the ecosystem. Although a few articles have highlighted Short term Volatility risks, overall the News is pushing for a Long term appreciation narrative.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Given the market‚Äôs position and the underlying resiliency of our aggressive investors, the market appears poised to continue appreciating and test Resistance prices, with short Consolidations along the way. On the other hand, if aggressive investors pull back to align with more conservative participants, that could trigger a Bearish Consolidation phase that would test the LOW Volatility Bands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long term Support and Resistances reveal that we are now sitting at our next anticipated Short term Neutral major pivot point. This point aligns with the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH, which, as well, aligns with the 3rd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001360. At MAX, I expect the price to build pressure and test the ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô, where I see us entering a stall range as the 9-Day moving average crosses over the 18-Day moving average at $0.00001420.
