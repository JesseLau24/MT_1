          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\n\"For if you soar too near that blazing orb, your craft, though artfully wrought, shall betray you, and you will find yourself cast down into the relentless sea.\"\n\nMomentum Indicators are showing Strong Bullish price movements as Buyers have regained control of the market. Although Short Sellers have kept the market active, the new wave of Buyers stepping forward is easing the pressure across multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, clearing us from our Consolidation benchmarks. Bollinger Bands are expanding again, which shows that the current Trend is building breakout strength; however, the HIGH Short term ADX value, signaling Strong Trend strength, also serves as an early hint of potential Overbought conditions. The price is ABOVE our Supertrend and all EMAs, confirming a return to active ‘Price Action’ and an attempt to develop a Long term Trend structure.\n\nVolatility Indicators have highlighted increased Volatility, yet it remains near the LOW end of our norms range. Price movements are nearing the HIGH of our Volatility Bands, confirming the early setup for a Bullish Consolidation. This could lead to a new breakout or, if Overbought conditions prevail, further Consolidation with an indecisive bias that will result in sideways price movements. Volume Indicators show mixed signals, as declining Volume combined with a neutral MFI serves as a warning that the current Trend is not strongly supported by trade volume. We could see a Retracement if Volume continues to decline. \n\nSentiment Indicators display positive signs of Strong accumulation, suggesting that ‘smart money’ is active in the Short term. All this recent activity has reinforced an emerging positive Trend cycle while weakening the Long term negative PVT Trend. News articles have been increasingly optimistic about the upside, using technical breakout signals. Continued coverage of burn rate surges and the anticipation of an institutional ETF catalyst have created Bullish buzz. The news is also monitoring whale activity, with articles showing increased whale market participation. Negative reports have largely focused on ‘black swan’ events as external catalysts, but overall the FUD/FOMO have been calmed for investors entering the market.\n\nDue to the underlying resiliency persistently shown throughout the charts, we have some upside potential if Volume picks up to test further Resistance prices. Though, without improvements in Volume, the Trend should begin to stall and Consolidate gains ABOVE our ‘Wall of Resistance’ before pulling back toward Support prices.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances indicate that we have reached our next anticipated Short term Neutral major pivot point at the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH, which sits just at the TOP of the ‘Wall of Resistance’, aligning with the 3rd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001360. At MAX, the price will attempt to cross over the 18-Day moving average at $0.00001430 and enter a stall range just before reaching the 1-Month HIGH at $0.00001520. If Volume struggles, at LOWEST the market will pull back to the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001280, near the TOP of the ‘Wall of Support’ that aligns with the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW at $0.00001250. Both the MAX potential for the day and the LOWEST potential are ranges, reflecting the current levels of broader market participation.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help.

Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.\n\nPetition:\n\nhttps://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition",

          "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI know this might sound like a bold prediction, but hear me out. Using the rollercoaster analogy, I believe Shiba Inu (SHIB) has the potential to reach $1. Here’s why:\n\n1. The Initial Ascent – Building Momentum:\nWhen you get on a rollercoaster, the first part is the slow climb to the top. SHIB's journey has been similar. From its creation, it started with little to no recognition, but as time passed, its community grew, its narrative gained momentum, and it became a widely recognized meme coin. That slow climb represents the groundwork SHIB has laid over the past few years — creating awareness, establishing a massive and passionate community, and gaining market credibility.\n\n2. The Big Drop – Volatility &amp; Wild Ride:\nEvery rollercoaster has that steep drop that gets your heart racing, and for SHIB, we've seen plenty of those moments. The price has swung up and down like crazy — wild pumps followed by corrections. This volatility might scare some investors, but for SHIB, it’s actually a sign of a healthy and active market. These swings are part of the excitement, showing that SHIB can move fast when the right catalyst hits, whether it’s partnerships, new use cases, or broader adoption.\n\n3. The Loops – New Developments:\nAs we reach the loops on a rollercoaster, the ride feels like it’s pushing you to new heights. For SHIB, these loops represent the ongoing developments in its ecosystem. From the launch of ShibaSwap, to upcoming features like Shiba Inu’s Layer 2 blockchain, to its potential entry into metaverse applications, every new update is like a loop propelling SHIB forward. Each loop gives the community something new to get excited about, keeping the ride thrilling and, importantly, keeping SHIB relevant in the ever-evolving crypto space.\n\n4. The Steady Climb Back Up – Real-World Adoption:\nAfter the loops, we get another climb. This is where the long-term value of SHIB really starts to show. We're seeing more and more businesses adopting SHIB as a payment method, and even the potential for integrations with major financial platforms. With real-world use cases and a steadily increasing demand, SHIB's upward climb is becoming more sustainable. This gradual climb is critical because it shows SHIB isn’t just a “pump and dump” token—it’s beginning to establish itself as something with staying power.\n\n5. The Final Drop &amp; $1 Target – The Ultimate Thrill:\nAnd just like that final plunge at the end of the rollercoaster, SHIB reaching $1 will be an exhilarating moment. The $1 mark might seem far off, but with increasing utility, ongoing burn mechanisms, a dedicated community, and the growing interest in meme coins, it’s not as impossible as it might sound. As we continue to see SHIB rise in popularity, both in the market and within mainstream adoption, the potential for that final drop (where SHIB hits $1) becomes more realistic. It’s all about building up momentum, leveraging the loops, and keeping the long-term vision clear.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nSure, the ride will be wild, and we’ll experience ups and downs, but the fundamentals and momentum behind SHIB are undeniable. Like a rollercoaster, the thrill is in the unpredictability — but when the ride finally hits its peak, it will be a spectacle to witness.\n\nHold tight, SHIB Army. We’re in for a hell of a ride.\n\nTL;DR: SHIB is like a rollercoaster — starting slow, picking up momentum, hitting some wild swings, and with ongoing developments and real-world adoption, it’s poised to take us to new heights, potentially hitting $1 in the future.\n\nLet me know your thoughts, and let’s discuss the ride ahead! 🚀🎢",

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know this might sound like a bold prediction, but hear me out. Using the rollercoaster analogy, I believe Shiba Inu (SHIB) has the potential to reach $1. Here’s why:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Initial Ascent – Building Momentum:\nWhen you get on a rollercoaster, the first part is the slow climb to the top. SHIB&amp;#39;s journey has been similar. From its creation, it started with little to no recognition, but as time passed, its community grew, its narrative gained momentum, and it became a widely recognized meme coin. That slow climb represents the groundwork SHIB has laid over the past few years — creating awareness, establishing a massive and passionate community, and gaining market credibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Big Drop – Volatility &amp;amp; Wild Ride:\nEvery rollercoaster has that steep drop that gets your heart racing, and for SHIB, we&amp;#39;ve seen plenty of those moments. The price has swung up and down like crazy — wild pumps followed by corrections. This volatility might scare some investors, but for SHIB, it’s actually a sign of a healthy and active market. These swings are part of the excitement, showing that SHIB can move fast when the right catalyst hits, whether it’s partnerships, new use cases, or broader adoption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Loops – New Developments:\nAs we reach the loops on a rollercoaster, the ride feels like it’s pushing you to new heights. For SHIB, these loops represent the ongoing developments in its ecosystem. From the launch of ShibaSwap, to upcoming features like Shiba Inu’s Layer 2 blockchain, to its potential entry into metaverse applications, every new update is like a loop propelling SHIB forward. Each loop gives the community something new to get excited about, keeping the ride thrilling and, importantly, keeping SHIB relevant in the ever-evolving crypto space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Steady Climb Back Up – Real-World Adoption:\nAfter the loops, we get another climb. This is where the long-term value of SHIB really starts to show. We&amp;#39;re seeing more and more businesses adopting SHIB as a payment method, and even the potential for integrations with major financial platforms. With real-world use cases and a steadily increasing demand, SHIB&amp;#39;s upward climb is becoming more sustainable. This gradual climb is critical because it shows SHIB isn’t just a “pump and dump” token—it’s beginning to establish itself as something with staying power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Final Drop &amp;amp; $1 Target – The Ultimate Thrill:\nAnd just like that final plunge at the end of the rollercoaster, SHIB reaching $1 will be an exhilarating moment. The $1 mark might seem far off, but with increasing utility, ongoing burn mechanisms, a dedicated community, and the growing interest in meme coins, it’s not as impossible as it might sound. As we continue to see SHIB rise in popularity, both in the market and within mainstream adoption, the potential for that final drop (where SHIB hits $1) becomes more realistic. It’s all about building up momentum, leveraging the loops, and keeping the long-term vision clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Final Thoughts:\nSure, the ride will be wild, and we’ll experience ups and downs, but the fundamentals and momentum behind SHIB are undeniable. Like a rollercoaster, the thrill is in the unpredictability — but when the ride finally hits its peak, it will be a spectacle to witness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hold tight, SHIB Army. We’re in for a hell of a ride.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: SHIB is like a rollercoaster — starting slow, picking up momentum, hitting some wild swings, and with ongoing developments and real-world adoption, it’s poised to take us to new heights, potentially hitting $1 in the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me know your thoughts, and let’s discuss the ride ahead! 🚀🎢&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nThese charts show mixed signals that seem to indicate an incoming Consolidation of the Uptrend cycle. Momentum Indicators reveal that Buy pressure is declining as Buyers become more indecisive. The KST indicates that Sellers are slowly gaining control in the Short term. Trend Indicators show that the price remains ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud yet is riding near its HIGH Band, which is an early sign of Consolidation. Bollinger Bands are beginning to fluctuate between contraction and expansion, confirming Consolidation as current Trend strength remains elevated and supports Overbought pressure. The price is resting at the Supertrend and just ABOVE the EMAs, meaning that ‘Price Action’ is on hold while investors gauge the Trend's direction. Volatility Indicators show that Volatility has declined to the LOWEST end of our norms range. With the price near the LOW of the Volatility Bands, it implies that Buyers may be losing conviction or growing indecisive. \n\nVolume Indicators demonstrate declining market participation from investors. When combined with MFI and CMF values, they signal that Short Sellers are in control of the market. This results in a Weak Neutral pressure as money flow now suggests that Short positions are having an impact. Sentiment Indicators highlight continued Strong accumulation, although this appears to be driven by Short positions from Short Sellers. In effect, Short Sellers are sustaining a new but Weak positive Trend cycle on their own. Profit-taking is building against the Uptrend. On a positive note, the charts indicate that this recent activity has further weakened the Long term negative PVT Trend cycle. News articles covered burn rate spikes, increased whale participation, and technical indicators of improving market fundamentals. They maintain a Bullish Long term bias while offering a mix of Short term caution. Articles use technical signals to draw attention to market volatility in general and highlight external dependencies, especially on Bitcoin.\nWhen all of this is combined, it gives me the sense that both investors and institutions are adopting a wait-and-see approach. No one wants to take the first step, which is convenient for market makers and algorithmic traders. With that in mind, the most likely Short term outcome is a Consolidation phase where investors protect profits before the market opens. I agree that we remain essentially bound to Bitcoin as our key external dependency, and without additional catalyst influences the market will continue business as usual. The charts support this viewpoint, and based on cluster data this type of movement is what I call the \"Weekend Usual\" … pump on a Friday, dump on a Sunday.\nLong term Support and Resistances reveal that the price is still resting WITHIN the ‘Wall of Resistance’, positioned in the stall range where the 3-Day moving average crosses over the 10-Day moving average at $0.00001290. At MAX, the price will attempt to test the highest prices of the ‘Wall of Resistance’, up to the 3rd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001360. At LOWEST, the price will retreat and enter the Support stall range, where the 3-Day, 10-Day, and 16-Day MACD moving averages converge at $0.00001240.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help. Make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.\n\nPetition:\n\nhttps://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition",

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nThe encouraging positive Trend cycle continues into today as Buyers maintain a Bullish Consolidation phase, as expected. Momentum Indicators signal that Buyers’ pressure is increasing in the market, yet the declining KST values reveal signs of Short Sellers entering. These Short Sellers are applying Short term Sell pressure while profit-taking combines with a reentry into profitability walls. Trend Indicators show that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, which confirms breakout. The Bollinger Bands are contracting again, confirming that breakout potential is building. The current ADX value shows Short term Average Trend strength approaching a HIGH pressure level. The price remains ABOVE our Supertrend and all EMAs, confirming ongoing ‘Price Action’.\n\nVolatility Indicators signal that Volatility is declining, with the Volatility Bands confirming increased breakout strength as price movements move ABOVE the HIGH Bands. Volume Indicators help confirm Short Selling. Both Short and Long term Volume are decreasing while an increasing amount of money is moving into the market compared to those flowing out. The MFI shows that Oversold conditions are shifting toward healthy Neutral levels. In other words, although there are outflows, more money is now flowing in, gradually equalizing the pressure.\n\nSentiment Indicators reveal that investors are accumulating at Strong levels, roughly where they were yesterday at this time. CCI values signal that the new positive Trend cycle has gained strength today, even though Short Selling and profit-taking have caused the Long term PVT value to reflect some continuation of the negative Trend cycle. News Sentiment offers an increasingly Bullish bias for Long term developments. Bullish articles highlight ecosystem utilization factors such as L3 blockchain integration, gaming/metaverse expansion, and general ecosystem upgrades. These fact-based reports create realistic optimism by projecting surges and rallies, often by highlighting Short term whale accumulation and favorable technical patterns. At the same time, some articles address profitability concerns around Sell walls. These realistic insights temper FUD/FOMO while positioning Shiba Inu as a utility asset rather than just a meme.\n\nAll of these signals are encouraging when combined with the resilience of the Short term Trend cycle, which continues to reinvigorate a positive Trend. Whale inflows and institutional interest are beginning to align with the supporting structures needed for Long term stability. Focusing on the Short term, however, the increased Short Selling and calculated Sell pressure suggest that we will see a continuation of Bullish appreciation, with constant Sell pressure holding back any explosive breakout. Although it will feel like a continuing Consolidation, slow price appreciation will persist into tomorrow.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances show that the current price is working its way through the ‘Wall of Resistance’ and testing Buyer conviction while lingering around the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001280. At MAX, the price will test higher Resistance prices up to the 3rd-level Resistance pivot point at $0.00001360. At its LOWEST, the price will retreat back into the Neutral zone and bounce off the ‘Wall of Support’ at the 1st-level Support pivot point at $0.00001240.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help.

Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.\n\nPetition:\n\nhttps://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition",

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nCharts show some of the pullback to Consolidation as Buyers hold the line through a wait-and-see phase. Momentum Indicators signal that while Buyer control has weakened, there is still positive Bullish pressure across multiple time frames, even as profit-taking introduces some Neutral pressure. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, confirming the Consolidation phase. Bollinger Bands are beginning to expand again, and Short term ADX values indicate Average Trend strength. The price is BELOW or AT our Supertrend and is still seeking Support at our EMA levels. This means that ‘Price Action’ has not been invalidated, but it is struggling.\n\nVolatility Indicators align with the Bollinger Bands’ expansion; Volatility has declined into the LOW end of our norms range. Price movements are riding the LOW Volatility Bands but have not dipped low enough to indicate Oversold conditions, suggesting a Neutral balance. Volume Indicators show that Buyers continue to step in, though at Weak levels through the dips, and currently investors are moving more money into the market than out. \n\nSentiment Indicators display stability in investor mindsets, with Strong signs of accumulation acting as support for a positive Trend cycle that has nearly disappeared, although a small trace still exists. This is further observed by the weakening PVT value, which reflects the lingering Long term negative Trend cycle the market is working through. News articles continue to highlight a Bullish Long term bias, covering major ecosystem developments, potential exchange listings, burn rate changes, and strategic partnerships (for example, with the UAE). They also maintain a balanced view by addressing whale outflows and Short term Volatility spikes. Overall, the market appears to be in a simple Consolidation phase, with investors waiting for clearer direction.\nI expect that during the Short term we will work our way through this Consolidation, and I see us picking up more Buy pressure into tomorrow, which should begin building breakout pressure this evening. For now, a stable Bullish Consolidation will continue.\nLong term Support and Resistances show that the market is testing the ‘Wall of Support’ at the 2nd standard price deviation at $0.00001260. At its LOWEST, the price will continue testing down to the 3rd-level Support pivot point at approximately $0.00001230. At its MAX, increased Buy pressure should push the price to test the ‘Wall of Resistance’ up to the stall range, where the 3-Day moving average crosses over the 10-Day moving average at $0.00001320.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help. Make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.\n\nPetition:\n\nhttps://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition",

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nThese charts look like they're finally showing early signs of breakout potential. Momentum Indicators signal that Buyers are holding Long term conviction, with price movements supported across multiple time frames to counteract lingering profit-taking. Trend Indicators show that the price remains WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, confirming a Consolidation phase. In addition, Short term ADX values indicate Average Trend strength, providing further confirmation. The price is holding ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs, which shows that despite the Consolidation and Downtrend pressure from profit-taking, there is still Weak ‘Price Action’. Bollinger Bands are further contracted, which is an early signal for breakout potential.\nVolatility Indicators support this view by showing that Volatility is beginning to rise toward a Neutral level, although it remains within the LOW range of our norms. Price movements are nearing the TOP of the Volatility Bands, and at this level, the Short term ADX indicates Average Trend strength. This means that while the market is not Overbought, it is ready for a breakout to test higher Resistance prices and establish new Supports. Volume Indicators highlight that profit-taking is easing and capitulation has subsided, resulting in a Neutral balance between Buyers and Sellers over the Long term. Buyers continue to control the money flow, with more capital entering the market than leaving. \n\nSentiment Indicators reinforce the breakout potential by revealing Strong accumulation and the strengthening of a Weak but positive new Trend cycle. We have attempted to start this cycle several times over the past couple of weeks; we will have to see how it develops! Good news is that Buyers have weakened the Long term PVT once again. News articles have been increasingly bullish regarding the positive developments indicated by our technical signals. They highlight HIGH trading volume and offer insights into the upcoming Binance expansion for Shiba Inu. By relying on charting and technical analysis rather than opinion, these articles help investors understand Short term Volatility while emphasizing the Long term Trend potential. This top-notch reporting is doing an excellent job of neutralizing FUD/FOMO for incoming investors.\nI’m seeing things starting to line up, and although the market remains in a Long term wait-and-see phase, investors are now testing the waters in the Short term. I anticipate a continuation of Bullish Uptrend pressure to test some of our Resistance benchmarks, as we have observed over the past week or two. At some point in that process, we will Consolidate the gains, resulting in what I refer to as a Bullish Consolidation outlook.\nLong term Support and Resistances reveal that the price is right ABOVE the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001270, resting at the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW. This is acting as the new Neutral major pivot point as predicted. At MAX, the price will build pressure and reach a stall range where the 3-Day moving average crosses over the 10-Day moving average at $0.00001320, which aligns with the 2nd-level Resistance pivot point. At LOWEST, the price will test the ‘Wall of Support’ and reach a stall range just ABOVE the 2nd-level Support pivot point at $0.00001220.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life.

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These charts look like they&amp;#39;re finally showing early signs of breakout potential. Momentum Indicators signal that Buyers are holding Long term conviction, with price movements supported across multiple time frames to counteract lingering profit-taking. Trend Indicators show that the price remains WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, confirming a Consolidation phase. In addition, Short term ADX values indicate Average Trend strength, providing further confirmation. The price is holding ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs, which shows that despite the Consolidation and Downtrend pressure from profit-taking, there is still Weak ‘Price Action’. Bollinger Bands are further contracted, which is an early signal for breakout potential.\nVolatility Indicators support this view by showing that Volatility is beginning to rise toward a Neutral level, although it remains within the LOW range of our norms. Price movements are nearing the TOP of the Volatility Bands, and at this level, the Short term ADX indicates Average Trend strength. This means that while the market is not Overbought, it is ready for a breakout to test higher Resistance prices and establish new Supports. Volume Indicators highlight that profit-taking is easing and capitulation has subsided, resulting in a Neutral balance between Buyers and Sellers over the Long term. Buyers continue to control the money flow, with more capital entering the market than leaving. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sentiment Indicators reinforce the breakout potential by revealing Strong accumulation and the strengthening of a Weak but positive new Trend cycle. We have attempted to start this cycle several times over the past couple of weeks; we will have to see how it develops! Good news is that Buyers have weakened the Long term PVT once again. News articles have been increasingly bullish regarding the positive developments indicated by our technical signals. They highlight HIGH trading volume and offer insights into the upcoming Binance expansion for Shiba Inu. By relying on charting and technical analysis rather than opinion, these articles help investors understand Short term Volatility while emphasizing the Long term Trend potential. This top-notch reporting is doing an excellent job of neutralizing FUD/FOMO for incoming investors.\nI’m seeing things starting to line up, and although the market remains in a Long term wait-and-see phase, investors are now testing the waters in the Short term. I anticipate a continuation of Bullish Uptrend pressure to test some of our Resistance benchmarks, as we have observed over the past week or two. At some point in that process, we will Consolidate the gains, resulting in what I refer to as a Bullish Consolidation outlook.\nLong term Support and Resistances reveal that the price is right ABOVE the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001270, resting at the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW. This is acting as the new Neutral major pivot point as predicted.

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nPlenty of healthy signals throughout this chart indicate that Buyers have rejected the Downtrend. Momentum Indicators show that Buyers are attempting to retake control of the market over multiple time frames, although they are contending with Sell pressure from profit-taking. This is a healthy sign of market participation and investor interest. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is AT our Ichimoku Cloud, confirming the Bullish Consolidation I was expecting. Bollinger Bands are again contracting at the same time that our Short term ADX values confirm Strong Trend strength. The price is holding ABOVE the Supertrend and is attempting to recapture price movements ABOVE all EMAs, meaning that the market desires ‘Price Action’.\n\nVolatility Indicators reveal that Volatility is falling, which aligns with the contraction of the Bollinger Bands. Price movements will be stable and small in either direction. The Volatility Bands show that the price is approaching confirmation of Overbought conditions; however, due to the balance of profit-taking, this is in line with a Bullish Consolidation phase where investors are building confidence. Volume Indicators confirm Short term profit-taking, with the MFI and CMF showing that Buyers are now moving more money into the market than is moving out.\n\nSentiment Indicators were increasingly optimistic today, with Strong signs of accumulation attempting to revitalize the previous positive Trend cycle. Despite these encouraging signs, the market is still struggling against the Long term Bearish Trend cycle, which strengthened because of profit-taking. News articles echoed yesterday's Bullish Long term Sentiment about the aggressive token burns, positive ecosystem network metrics, and analyst endorsements that are making the case for Long term growth. At the same time, they still highlighted the Short term risks of whale outflows and covered cautionary analyst warnings. Overall, this balanced coverage is doing a great job of easing FUD/FOMO. I have to give a big thumbs-up to the recent News coverage of Shiba Inu. It is realistic!\n\nI see many encouraging signs, and with the latest FOMC press conference, I think we can expect the market to enter a wait-and-see phase with a more Bullish mindset. One of our largest external catalysts appears to be using hard data rather than Sentiment, and I will watch that closely. I believe investors will begin to feel more comfortable entering the market again, and in the Short term, we can expect a buildup of breakout pressure. I anticipate the market will begin testing the higher Resistance prices to establish new Neutral Support zones.\n\nLooking at Long term Support and Resistances shows that we recaptured our Neutral major pivot point by resting at the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW at $0.00001280; this will be our rough Neutral major pivot point for today. At MAX, the market will attempt to test the full range of the ‘Wall of Resistance’, and I expect a stall range for the next establishment of a Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001410, which is the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH this time. At its LOWEST, the price will retreat and bounce off the top of the ‘Wall of Support’ at the 1st-level pivot point at $0.00001210.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help.

Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.\n\nPetition:\n\nhttps://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition",

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nThere are some encouraging signs as it appears that despite the overall Downtrend pressure, investors still retained Long term Bullish optimism. Momentum Indicators show that the price has moved to clear Oversold conditions. Buyers capitulated across multiple time frames, leading to the Downtrend pressure. Trend Indicators reveal that the price fell BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, but the Bollinger Bands have begun to contract again. Short term ADX values confirm the Oversold strength of the Bearish Downtrend. The price is firmly BELOW the Supertrend and all EMAs, confirming Consolidation. Volatility Indicators show declining Volatility, with the Volatility Bands confirming Oversold Consolidation. These are all signs that breakout pressure is building. \n\nVolume Indicators signal Short term conviction, as an increased number of Buyers stepped into the dips nearly neutralizing the outflow of money from the Downtrend. Currently, barely more money is flowing out of the market than in. The MFI confirms deep Oversold territory. Sentiment Indicators reveal the resilience of investor convictions, with Strong signs of accumulation throughout the Downtrend. Although we have reverted to the previous negative Trend cycle and slightly reinforced it, Buyers’ conviction is holding enough to counteract Bearish Sell pressures. News Sentiment aligns with the market, as articles tap into both psychological and technical indicators. Majority of articles offered a Long term Bullish bias by highlighting aggressive token burns, positive technical reversals, and potential institutional catalysts. At the same time, they draw attention to Short term risks of Volatility by revealing whale outflows and price declines. This balanced coverage helps stave off FUD/FOMO.\n\nGiven these encouraging Indicators, it appears that during this Downtrend we approached our Oversold benchmarks and will begin Consolidating the Downtrend. This will usher in a Neutral/Bullish wait-and-see phase through the Short term as investors look for signals of the market’s direction.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances show that the ‘Support and Resistance Walls’ are beginning to tighten the Neutral zone. The current price rests just inside the top of the ‘Wall of Support’ at the 1st-level pivot point at $0.00001240. This is roughly where I expected our LOW to be, and I don’t see us going much lower today. At MAX, we should attempt to recapture our Neutral zone between the ‘Support and Resistance Walls’, up to the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001310.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help. Make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.\n\nPetition:\n\nhttps://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition",
