Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nOh, it's not as optimistic as I was hoping to see, as some of those choppy market conditions never really eased up. There appears to be a buildup of a loss of conviction among Buyers. Momentum Indicators signal that Momentum is near Oversold conditions, yet the Weak Buyer presence is enough to maintain a degree of positive pressure across multiple time frames. Trend Indicators show that the price is BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud while Bollinger Bands continue to expand, supporting Consolidation. ADX values indicate that the current Trend is moving with Average Trend strength. In the Short term the price remains ABOVE our Supertrend and all EMAs, though it is attempting to retreat toward our 12‚ÄëDay EMA.\n\nVolatility Indicators reveal an increase in Volatility, with price movements now nearing the HIGH end of our norms range. As a result, price movements will begin to exhibit greater variation in either direction. The Volatility Bands confirm Consolidation and show that Oversold conditions are closing in on the current price. Volume Indicators signal an increase in Short term Volume and sustained, Neutral levels of market participation. However, the CMF confirms that more money is now starting to flow out of the market than in, meaning that Buyers are losing control.\n\nSentiment Indicators are mixed but do confirm Strong Distribution and the potential early signs of a breakdown in the recently developed positive Trend cycle that Buyers were nurturing. PVT still shows that despite the price decline, the Long term negative Trend cycle has weakened even further today. News Sentiment has been seemingly Bullish, with articles that incorporate more analytics each day rather than relying solely on opinions. I find it interesting to see News articles focusing on technical Support and Resistance levels as well as detailed burn updates. Their sustained, healthy coverage and approach continues to help alleviate FUD/FOMO. Every little bit counts!\n\nI want to look at this from a purely technical perspective, as it appears that we are at the beginning of a price‚Äëlocked market where the price of Bitcoin, market makers, and high‚Äëfrequency algorithmic traders are converging and influencing a buildup of capitulation. I interpret this in the Long term as a general desensitization where investors no longer want to deal with everything looking good one day and then falling apart the next, much like a Strong company in a traditional financial system that still struggles. This can only technically mean a wait‚Äëand‚Äësee phase of indecision, where investors hold with less and less trust.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances show that the price is AT the 38.2% retracement of the 4‚ÄëWeek LOW at $0.00001280, acting as the Neutral major pivot point. The Neutral zone is expanding, which typically implies sideways price movements. At MAX, I see the price bouncing off the BOTTOM of the ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô at the 1st pivot point at $0.00001310. At its LOWEST, the price will bounce off the TOP of the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô at the 1st standard price deviation at $0.00001220.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help.

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nThese are the signs I was hoping to see, as the market shows healthy signals of Consolidating gains to an expected Resistance level followed by attempts to establish a new Neutral Support zone. Momentum Indicators show a Weak Bullish drive in price movements, with Buyers retaining control of the market even as profit-taking creates Neutral pressure across multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is riding the HIGH Band of the Ichimoku Cloud and attempting to sustain movements ABOVE this benchmark. Meanwhile, the Bollinger Bands are beginning to expand again, indicating an early confirmation of Consolidation. The positive note here is that the price has managed to sustain AT or ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs.\n\nLooking at Volatility Indicators, Volatility is highlighting Weak Bearish movements as measured by the ATR, which indicates that overall Volatility remains LOW while pressure is building around the HIGH Bands of our Donchian and Keltner. This confirms that Buyers are exercising a healthy level of caution rather than succumbing to FUD/FOMO, and are patiently awaiting stronger signals for the market's next direction. Volume Indicators signal continued profit-taking, which has only served to Neutralize the flow of money through the market. \n\nSentiment Indicators confirm the cautious mindset among investors, with Buyers maintaining Strong-to-Average levels of accumulation. Their current and sustained presence in the market has nurtured the positive Trend cycle in its early stages. PVT confirms that the previous negative Trend cycle has weakened significantly as of today. News articles revealed insights into investor psychology, with Long term Bullish bias driven by influential figures in the crypto space and their positive takes on the profitability improvements we are witnessing. Other articles touched on the collapse in burn rate and whale outflows in the Short term, highlighting the risks and Volatility potential. \n\nBased on these encouraging signals and broader price movements among crypto, it appears that the market is likely to move through Consolidation while building price appreciation in an attempt to hold ABOVE higher Resistance prices. Buy Volume will be crucial; as Volume increases validate the Trend's direction. More aggressive Momentum will bolster investor confidence. If Volume remains indecisive, however, the rally we're currently seeing may pull back into Consolidation. Sentiment will be king, so watch for signs of increasing conviction, or the lack thereof, as we enter a choppy period.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances show that we're holding ABOVE the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW, which we could consider our Short term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001320. At MAX, the next target will be to establish a Neutral range ABOVE the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001470. At its LOWEST, the market will Consolidate and attempt to retreat BELOW the current Mid term ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô, which will be just ABOVE the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001240.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help.

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nCharts indicate that investors are Buying, yet with realistic caution. Momentum Indicators show Weak Bullish price movements that highlight how Buyers, balanced with profit-taking, have created a Neutral pressure across multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud but near the HIGH of the Bollinger Bands as they contract further. Strong Short term ADX values, the price being ABOVE the Supertrend, and all EMAs confirm the resiliency of ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô.\n\nVolatility Indicators signal declining Volatility values that are approaching the LOW end of our norms range. Combined with the narrowing Bollinger Bands, this implies that a potential Bullish breakout is beginning to emerge. With prices hovering near the HIGH of our Volatility Bands, the buildup of breakout Volatility in the Short term is further confirmed. Volume Indicators highlight a Weak Volume decline, which is a sign that profit-taking is an issue. However, despite the Sell pressure, Buyers are holding control of the market by moving more money in than out. \n\nSentiment Indicators continue to show the building pressure that supports the newly emerging positive Trend cycle. Strong accumulation and a weakening Long term PVT value indicate that Buyers are sustaining a buildup of positive Momentum over multiple time frames. News articles carry Long term optimism regarding the ecosystem‚Äôs aggressive burns and the anticipated institutional developments surrounding the UAE Reserve, as well as strong whale activity that supports the potential for gains. However, articles have also highlighted some underlying leadership concerns and mixed technical signals that advise caution regarding Short term Volatility. I consider this a healthy mix of insights for the psychology of investors entering the market.\n\nGiven the continuing signs of a developing positive Trend cycle and cautiously Bullish investor Sentiments, we should begin breaking and holding ABOVE our Resistance benchmarks. This does require an increase in Volume from its current values. Though, if Volume remains Weak, there is a risk of a Consolidation phase.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances indicated that the price is resting ABOVE the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001240 in the Neutral zone, just BELOW the ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô. At MAX, if Buy Volume increases, the market will test the midpoint ABOVE the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW at $0.00001320. It will begin showing signs of its next direction around the 18-Day moving average at $0.00001340. At LOWEST, Consolidation will lead to the top of the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô, around the 1st standard price deviation at $0.00001230.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help. Make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.\n\nPetition:\n\nhttps://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition",

I consider this a healthy mix of insights for the psychology of investors entering the market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Given the continuing signs of a developing positive Trend cycle and cautiously Bullish investor Sentiments, we should begin breaking and holding ABOVE our Resistance benchmarks. This does require an increase in Volume from its current values. Though, if Volume remains Weak, there is a risk of a Consolidation phase.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long term Support and Resistances indicated that the price is resting ABOVE the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001240 in the Neutral zone, just BELOW the ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô. At MAX, if Buy Volume increases, the market will test the midpoint ABOVE the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW at $0.00001320. It will begin showing signs of its next direction around the 18-Day moving average at $0.00001340. At LOWEST, Consolidation will lead to the top of the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô, around the 1st standard price deviation at $0.00001230.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they&amp;#39;re the most important to you in the world. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The petition still needs your help.

Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nThe market is continuing with the previous recovery signs that were Weak yesterday but are now approaching some truly impressive strength across many sectors that I follow. Momentum Indicators show that price movements are supported by increased Buyer presence in the market. Buyers have begun to place positive pressure across multiple time frames, allowing them to hold a Weak control.\n\nTrend Indicators signal that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud while Bollinger Bands continue to expand. Short term ADX values reveal that the current Trend strength is sustaining Strong pressure. The price is ABOVE our Supertrend and all EMAs, which confirms ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô. Volatility Indicators show that Volatility continues to stabilize around the Neutral range of our norms, while price movements remain within the Volatility Bands, approaching confirmation of Overbought conditions. Volume Indicators reveal continued profit-taking at a level that attempts to match the current Buy Volume, leading to a Neutral flow of money. \n\nSentiment Indicators highlight persistent levels of distribution throughout the market stemming from profit-taking during the Uptrend. The current market has developed the Weak beginnings of a new positive Trend cycle. PVT still shows that the overall market has quite a bit of ground to claw back through, but the Long term Downtrend is beginning to weaken. News articles showed some positive bias toward aggressive burns, strong community and whale activity, and updated analyst price targets that implied support for a Long term rally. Nevertheless, there were articles that covered Short term challenges, offering critical alerts and highlighting potential Sell pressures, which suggested healthy insights for investors to consider entering on dips around Support prices and being mindful of Volatility.\n\nMany markets are showing recovery and Uptrend pressure as Buyers step in. Yet, following basic price dynamics, the Short term will need to Consolidate the gains at some point. I expect that with these values across the Indicator classes, we still have some room for price appreciation while the market finds Neutral Support levels to reestablish the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô and ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances show that the current price is resting in a stall range around the 9-Day moving average at $0.00001270. This is just BELOW the expected Neutral Consolidation point at the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW at $0.00001320. At MAX, I can see the price crossing ABOVE the 18-Day moving average just ABOVE that 38.2% retracement level at $0.00001360 and entering a stall range extending up to an interesting level where our 3-Day, 10-Day, and 16-Day MACD moving averages converge at $0.00001400. At its LOWEST, the price will retreat to the Neutral major pivot point, just below the ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô at $0.00001200.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life.

Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nThe market is still experiencing some of the same external influences, which appear to be placing renewed pressure on investors. Momentum Indicators signal that these Bearish price movements are not enough to give outright control of the market to Sellers, but they have diminished Buyers' control significantly. Buyers retain Weak Bullish pressure across multiple time frames to support Consolidation phases rather than a market downturn.\n\nTrend Indicators show that the price is falling BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud while the Bollinger Bands begin to expand again. The price is lingering around the Supertrend but is just BELOW our EMAs. A look at the ADX values signals that this is capitulation on the part of a minority archetype. Volatility Indicators highlight a decline in Volatility movements, leading to Neutral conditions across the market. They also confirm that the market is entering a wait-and-see phase of indecision in the LOW Bands, which appears to mark the beginning of Oversold conditions.\n\nSentiment Indicators reveal Strong distribution throughout the market, which is in line with the capitulation of psychological Trend pressure as shown by other Indicator classes. Although we see the rejection of a new positive Trend cycle, we also see a rejection of a return to the negative Trend cycle. Even though distribution levels are HIGH, they were only enough to barely weaken the overall PVT. News articles attempted to highlight Long term catalysts such as ecosystem innovation, strategic products, and institutional interest. However, they also address Bearish Short term technical setbacks and recent lows, reflecting considerable volatility that is worth keeping in mind. I do not often find myself agreeing with the News, but lately they have done well at tempering FUD/FOMO.\n\nGiven the many signs of resiliency across the Indicators, I understand the overwhelming Sell pressure dominating many markets due to external market factors. However, given the numerous attempts to revitalize a reversal, Consolidation will most likely be our outlook for the foreseeable future. There is slight downside risk involved, but that risk would come after the price runs sideways over the Long term rather than during the current Short term phase.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances show that we are right ABOVE the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô, within the Neutral zone, just BELOW the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001220. At its LOWEST, the price will find its way into the midpoint of our ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô at the 2nd-level pivot point at $0.00001140. At its MAX, the price is going to attempt to test the ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô and cross over the 9-Day moving average, where we would expect to see a pullback into Consolidation around $0.00001280.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help.

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nThe charts indicate that the Uptrend cycle is working itself into a healthy groove that has continued into today, signaling that this so far is a stable reversal. Momentum Indicators show an average strength Bullish Trend in which Buyers are slowly stepping in at greater numbers. Outright, Buyers are in control of the market and are beginning to assert positive pressure across multiple time frames, leading to a healthy Neutral Volatility. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is holding ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud while Bollinger Bands are beginning to tighten again. Short term ADX values confirm that the current Trend strength is at an average level. The price is ABOVE the Supertrend and the 12-Day and 50-Day EMAs, and it is slowly working its way up to the 200-Day EMA in an effort to revitalize ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô in the market.\n\nVolatility Indicators signal that Volatility is stabilizing to the mid-levels of our norms while price movements remain within our Volatility Bands. Price movements within the Volatility Bands confirm stability over the market, which appears quite similar to a Consolidation phase. Volume Indicators show the continuation of profit taking with Weak outflows in the market, yet Long term investor interest remains Strong. Price movements during this Trend cycle show steady strength and pressure, with more money beginning to flow into the market than out.\n\nSentiment Indicators highlight improving investor psychology along with increasing positive News Sentiment. CO shows Strong accumulation in the market with the initial signs of a new positive Trend cycle. Keep in mind that the PVT value still shows -5,151.32, meaning there is some ground to recover from the previous Trend. Technically, the negative Trend is not over, but we are beginning to reverse it; in the Short term, we can consider this the start of a new positive Trend cycle. News had mixed Sentiment, with Bullish articles emphasizing growing social media mentions, technical rebound patterns, and recovery predictions for SHIB, while Bearish articles highlighted the 43% crash and uncertainty around recovery efforts. News offers a healthy positive Long term outlook combined with realistic Short term warnings.\n\nGiven that other markets are also showing signs of recovery, I expect to see Consolidation phases leaning toward an upside bias. This means we should see a stable price appreciation that establishes and tests new Neutral zones. There is some downside risk. If Volume Indicators reveal an increase in Sell pressure from external market influences; that would be Sentiment pressure. I think the market is starting to become a little bit more desensitized each day. I'm not really sure how to feel about that, but as an investor, emotions are irrelevant. Every data point adds a little more flavor to the tea!\n\nLong term Support and Resistances show that we're in the Neutral zone ABOVE the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001180. At MAX, following slow but stable price movements, the market will attempt to reach the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW at $0.00001330. At its LOWEST, the price will reach a stall point where the 3-Day moving average crosses over the 10-Day moving average at $0.00001150, just ABOVE the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help.

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nThere's the reversal I was expecting, but it was taking its sweet time. Momentum Indicators reveal that the market is beginning to load up with Buyers stepping in at the low prices, accelerating the rate of change over multiple time frames and weakening the underlying Bearish Trend. Trend Indicators show that the price is working ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, bouncing off the TOP BAND with ADX pressure signaling that this current Trend has built up to average Trend strength. That is a very healthy sign given that it is a reversal, meaning that we are quite stable. The price is ABOVE the Supertrend and our 12-Day and 50-Day EMAs and is working on approaching the 200-Day. Making it ABOVE the 200-Day would validate ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô. Bollinger Bands are beginning to tighten again. Volatility Indicators signal that Volatility has increased to the HIGH range of our norms while the Volatility Bands confirm the breakout strength rather than Oversold pressure.\n\nVolume Indicators continue to show positive accumulation throughout the market as increasing Volume rates indicate Buyers beginning to stabilize the market. An increase in the CMF reveals that, despite more money flowing out of the market than in, these act as signs of market participation from profit-taking. Sentiment Indicators are highlighting the psychological struggles at the root of this Downtrend. Continued Strong distribution with signs that the market is struggling to establish a Trend cycle aligns with the price movement. In my opinion, this is textbook cognitive dissonance. Long term News Sentiment remains Bullish, with articles highlighting aggressive token burns, strong institutional and community support, and promises of technical breakouts. Their current Short term market narrative was mixed with insights about Volatility from Support losses, along with lingering Sell pressure. It appears that all the correct ingredients are in place for this to be a successful market, yet the psychology is off and that is the real struggle. \n\nWith the work I have done over the past several months regarding Sentiment studies, the market needs to slowly regain trust. There is so much dissonance at this point that I expect if an Uptrend begins, the masses will follow. Likewise, if we continue this Downtrend cycle, the only outcome will be that it scares investors and drives them into different asset classes. I still see a silver lining for the current market, and I do not expect us to struggle with Sell pressure much longer. Things are already showing signs of softening and, with the incoming reversal, a stable appreciation is expected. Remember what I said about the need to feel trust. The market needs to approach higher Neutral major pivot points and then Consolidate. This repeating process will occur slowly over the next few days.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances show that the price rests AT the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001220. At LOWEST, the price will slide back down to our 13-Week LOW at $0.00001090. At its MAX, the price is going to attempt to Consolidate around the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW at $0.00001330.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help. Make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.\n\nPetition:\n\nhttps://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition",

Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nWe're finally starting to Consolidate the Downtrend, which should begin to stabilize the market soon. Momentum Indicators reveal that the market is entering its Neutral zone. Dip buying smoothed out the Downtrend over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators show that we are BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, the Supertrend, and all EMAs. When we look at our ADX values for both the Long and Short term, they are showing declining Trend strengths, meaning that the Downtrend is losing steam. Bollinger Bands are beginning to expand, while Volatility Indicators highlight increased price movements that reflect a recovery from Oversold conditions. Price movements are now rising from the LOW Volatility Bands, confirming the recovery. Volume Indicators support the signs of a Trend reversal with continued positive accumulation working to counteract the Sell pressure. The CMF indicates that this is a Consolidating phase, with only slightly more money flowing out of the market than in.\n\nSentiment Indicators signal Strong underlying distribution throughout the market, while CCI values indicate the beginning of a new positive Trend cycle. News articles retained a Bullish sentiment by highlighting aggressive token burns, ecosystem developments, and potential institutional catalysts such as ETF inclusion, while urging investors to brace for Short term Volatility. With early signs of stabilization and some conflicting signals in the Indicators, we are poised for breakout potential if any positive external catalyst occurs.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances show that the current price is just BELOW our ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô and resting ABOVE the 1-Month LOW at $0.00001140. The market has little room for further decline without triggering a collapse of the entire crypto market. The LOWEST possible price we could reach is our 52-Week LOW at $0.00001080. At MAX, the price will again attempt to retake the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001330.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help. Make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.\n\nPetition:\n\nhttps://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition",

Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nWow, what a busy day today with lots of work outdoors as the weather is starting to warm up. It seems that I called it spot on yesterday, as we are falling to that LOWEST price range. Any lower beyond this point would require some kind of signal that Shiba Inu has absolutely failed, but in the broader market context we can see that we are trading at the LOWEST possible prices before a rebound occurs.\n\nMomentum Indicators reveal that the Downtrend had picked up more Sell pressure and has truly crossed the threshold of Oversold conditions, spanning multiple time frames. Trend Indicators signal that the price is BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, the Supertrend, and all EMAs. The Short and Long term ADX values are approaching the absolute maximum level of Trend strength that this Indicator can produce. With the Bollinger Bands tightening even further and such Strong Trend strength in a Downtrend, it shows that this is about as bad as it can look when Sell pressure maxes out against our market. Volume Indicators offer insightful, optimistic values that show Buyers are continually stepping into the dip. The dip buying is so Strong that it has reversed the flow of money; now more money is flowing into the market than out at the bottom of an extreme Downtrend. That is quite an amazing feat of resiliency.\n\nSentiment Indicators show the same resilient picture of Strong accumulation throughout the market, as the Trend cycle has maxed out on negative pressure. News articles are highlighting this pivotal moment by combining a Bullish outlook for developments like Shibarium and potential ETFs with signs of Short term Volatility driven by aggressive token burns and whale sell-offs, ultimately urging optimism.\n\nGiven the market's extreme Oversold Momentum combined with Strong Bearish Trend values, it is clear that this Sell pressure is quite persistent. Falling any lower than current values would signal that Shiba Inu is done for as an asset, but when we take a broader view of the market context influencing all top 20 cryptocurrencies, we can tell that we are approaching the LOWEST point, which could indicate that a catalyst is incoming. It is my expectation that in the Short term we will begin to see Consolidation phases as the Sell pressure runs its full course. This chart will stand out among my clustered data as the full weight of Sentiment is truly being observed right now.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances show that we are BELOW the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô and currently resting at our 13-Week LOW at $0.00001170. The only place left to go is our 52-Week LOW at $0.00001080. If we breach this price, the LOWEST possible price before extreme Buy Volume picks up would be at $0.00000900, where the 14-Day RSI will approach 20%. At MAX, the price is going to attempt to retake that Neutral major pivot point ABOVE the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô at $0.00001330.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help.
