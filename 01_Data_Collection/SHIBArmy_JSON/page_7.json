          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nCharts show that the Consolidation phase is still lingering in the market as investors look for signs of which direction the market is headed next. Momentum Indicators reveal that the current price movements are entering a Neutral phase. Sell pressure is perfectly matching Buy pressure over multiple time frames.\n\nTrend Indicators show that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud yet BELOW the Supertrend. The price hovering around the 12-Day and 50-Day EMAs with a HIGH Short term ADX value, implies that pressure is building in the market. This looks like an early sign of investor interest through the weekend. Bollinger Bands are still tightening over the short range. Volatility Indicators show a gradual increase, approaching the Neutral range of our Volatility norms. The price movements through the Volatility Bands support this Consolidation phase, as shown by the other Indicator classes.\n\nVolume Indicators are mixed. In the Short term, we see Bullish Buyers stepping forward, but over the Long term, Sell pressure remains Strong. This has been counteracting the Trend for several days now. MFI reveals that the lingering Sell pressure has begun to mount against the Uptrend, with more money now flowing out of the market than in.\n\nSentiment Indicators signal that investors still hold a Neutral mindset. The distribution is quite Strong, but it hasn‚Äôt been enough to invalidate the positive Trend cycle that we‚Äôve established over the past 48 hours. Given that the PVT was only slightly weakened by this outflow, it suggests that the Sell pressure could be nearing the end of its potential. News articles have been increasingly optimistic about potential forecasts and the impact that milestones within the ecosystem could have. Some articles have offered healthy insights regarding sudden technical fakeouts and the need to time Short term market entries due to HIGH Volatility. This shows that investors entering the market are being influenced by a balanced outlook. Being optimistic yet aware of the risks is more attractive to conservative investors.\n\nGiven that the underlying investor psychology is increasingly optimistic and the Sell pressure has not deterred the Uptrend potential, I expect that the price will attempt to test Resistance levels and establish Support around ABOVE our EMAs. Expect a pullback toward lower Support ranges if Sell pressure intensifies. Though, the market is in good shape currently, so at worst a Short term Consolidation is more likely if Sell pressure increases further beyond its current levels.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances show that we are BELOW the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001350, still within the Neutral range just ABOVE the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô. Due to the underlying breakout potential, should more Buy pressure overcome the current Sell pressure, the price will attempt to cross over the 9-Day moving average at $0.00001370 before facing a tight midpoint of the ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô from the 1st-level pivot point up to the 2nd standard price deviation at $0.00001380. Looking a little into tomorrow, if we can maintain Support ABOVE the midpoint of the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô at the 2nd standard price deviation at $0.00001380, it opens up the MAX range potential up to our 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001410. At its LOWEST, any further increases in Sell pressure will only drive the price to the bottom of the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô at the 3rd-level pivot point, at $0.00001250.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help.

Sell pressure is perfectly matching Buy pressure over multiple time frames.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trend Indicators show that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud yet BELOW the Supertrend. The price hovering around the 12-Day and 50-Day EMAs with a HIGH Short term ADX value, implies that pressure is building in the market. This looks like an early sign of investor interest through the weekend. Bollinger Bands are still tightening over the short range. Volatility Indicators show a gradual increase, approaching the Neutral range of our Volatility norms. The price movements through the Volatility Bands support this Consolidation phase, as shown by the other Indicator classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Volume Indicators are mixed. In the Short term, we see Bullish Buyers stepping forward, but over the Long term, Sell pressure remains Strong. This has been counteracting the Trend for several days now. MFI reveals that the lingering Sell pressure has begun to mount against the Uptrend, with more money now flowing out of the market than in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sentiment Indicators signal that investors still hold a Neutral mindset. The distribution is quite Strong, but it hasn‚Äôt been enough to invalidate the positive Trend cycle that we‚Äôve established over the past 48 hours. Given that the PVT was only slightly weakened by this outflow, it suggests that the Sell pressure could be nearing the end of its potential. News articles have been increasingly optimistic about potential forecasts and the impact that milestones within the ecosystem could have. Some articles have offered healthy insights regarding sudden technical fakeouts and the need to time Short term market entries due to HIGH Volatility. This shows that investors entering the market are being influenced by a balanced outlook. Being optimistic yet aware of the risks is more attractive to conservative investors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Given that the underlying investor psychology is increasingly optimistic and the Sell pressure has not deterred the Uptrend potential, I expect that the price will attempt to test Resistance levels and establish Support around ABOVE our EMAs. Expect a pullback toward lower Support ranges if Sell pressure intensifies. Though, the market is in good shape currently, so at worst a Short term Consolidation is more likely if Sell pressure increases further beyond its current levels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long term Support and Resistances show that we are BELOW the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001350, still within the Neutral range just ABOVE the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô. Due to the underlying breakout potential, should more Buy pressure overcome the current Sell pressure, the price will attempt to cross over the 9-Day moving average at $0.00001370 before facing a tight midpoint of the ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô from the 1st-level pivot point up to the 2nd standard price deviation at $0.00001380. Looking a little into tomorrow, if we can maintain Support ABOVE the midpoint of the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô at the 2nd standard price deviation at $0.00001380, it opens up the MAX range potential up to our 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001410. At its LOWEST, any further increases in Sell pressure will only drive the price to the bottom of the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô at the 3rd-level pivot point, at $0.00001250.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life.

Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nLooking over these charts, it's interesting because the accumulation and Buy pressure are in place, yet the current Trend shows signs of struggle as it enters a Consolidation. This implies that external market factors are at work. Looking at our Momentum Indicators, the current price movements are being strongly influenced by Buy pressure over multiple time frames, though the rapid change in price direction during the Short term appears to show Buyers struggling to maintain Neutral ground.\n\nTrend Indicators highlight that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud yet ABOVE the Supertrend. Combined with the price hovering around the 12-Day and 50-Day EMAs while holding a Short term ADX value of 62.55, this means that the current Downtrend is being influenced by Sell pressure from external market factors rather than by an inherent Weakness in the Trend cycle. Bollinger Bands are tightening again with a further decline in Volatility. With Volatility reaching the LOWEST range of our norms while price movements bounce through the Volatility Bands, Consolidation is being supported and a setup for breakout pressure is forming. Volume Indicators reveal that investors are exiting positions, yet the sustained underlying Buy pressure is resisting the outflow. Despite the declining price movements, more money is still flowing into the market than out. \n\nSentiment Indicators reveal a confident mindset among investors. Strong accumulation mixed with increasingly positive Trend cycle values indicates that this Short term Sell pressure is being matched by Buy pressure. News articles have maintained a tempered yet outright positive tone toward Shiba Inu. Most have focused on aggressive token burns and increased whale activity. Others covered promising technical signs such as breakouts and high transaction volumes. However, some articles also highlighted persistent Short term challenges and Bearish signals like ‚ÄòDeath Crosses‚Äô, implying that sustained price growth may be a struggle. I disagree with that perspective, but overall, I think it's healthy to have an objective mindset. The News coverage has helped some investors develop a healthier approach, with less predisposition to FUD/FOMO.\n\nGiven the resiliency of the Buy pressure and the broader market signals I'm seeing, the likelihood of continued Downtrend pressure is very mild at this point. I would expect Consolidation phases with increasing Volatility to lead to Short term price appreciations. Essentially, the market may trade sideways until external pressures either subside or provide better clarity for more conservative investors. Since we're currently in a Downtrend, we're likely to see aggressive investors stepping in. Especially as these investors are monitoring many of the same indicators we follow.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances indicate that the price rests just ABOVE the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001320. I anticipate that our LOWEST point for any pullback will again be in the stall range, where the 3-Day moving average crosses over the 10-Day moving average at $0.00001300. At MAX, due to the underlying Buy pressure and the market‚Äôs resiliency, the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW at $0.00001410 will represent the highest potential for the current market.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help.

Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.\n\nPetition:\n\nhttps://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition",

Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nNice to see that Sell pressure is beginning to cool off as the market appears to be strengthening itself against FUD/FOMO with cautious Buy Volume. Momentum Indicators signal a Weak Bullish Momentum gaining strength as Buyers step forward at lower prices to smooth the underlying Sell pressure. KST indicates that this pressure has been countered across multiple time frames, leading to a Neutral balance between Buyers and Sellers.\n\nTrend Indicators show that the price is still WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, which is a sign of Consolidation and indecision. Bollinger Bands are still tightening, with volatility slowly declining. This is an early sign for incoming potential market movements. With the price ABOVE the Supertrend and our 12-Day and 50-Day EMAs, the strength of our current ADX value indicates that the current Trend has plenty of room to appreciate before signaling Overbought conditions.\n\nVolatility Indicators highlight a decline in Volatility as the price rebounds from Oversold values, as indicated by its movement through the Volatility Bands. The price‚Äôs position within the Bands supports Bullish Consolidation with stable price movements.\n\nVolume Indicators signal that Short term profit-taking is about the only counteracting pressure to the increasing Buy Volume, which has officially neutralized the negative outflow of money from the market. More money is now beginning to flow in than out over the past multiple time frames, putting us at the Neutral ground for Buy and Sell pressures.\n\nSentiment Indicators show the underlying caution with which investors are holding firm. There are Strong signs of accumulation in the market, leading to a positive Trend cycle, yet the price still needs to work back through the negative PVT that had developed. News Sentiment was increasingly optimistic about the aggressive token burns and the potential for mainstream institutional approval. This should bolster Long term investor confidence. However, there have also been articles highlighting some Short term technical uncertainties and SHIB‚Äôs underperformance against Bitcoin, which underscores the volatility and unpredictability of the market. This tempered view is a healthy mindset for investors entering the market and may help attract more conservative participants.\n\nGiven the resilience of the market indicated by these metrics, I would expect that we trade in a tight range as Buyers begin to test Short term Resistances. If Bullish pressure and Buy Volume continue to support the current build-up, we should move sideways with stable price appreciation. These movements will test each Resistance level as the market attempts to Consolidate and establish a new Neutral zone.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances show that the price rests ABOVE the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001290 in the tightening Neutral zone. At its MAX, the price in the Short term will try to reach the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001410. At its LOWEST, we will slide back into a stall range, where the 3-Day moving average crosses over the 10-Day moving average at $0.00001230.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help.

Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.\n\nPetition:\n\nhttps://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition",

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nFluctuations in the charts signal that this is the Consolidation phase of the Bearish downturn. Indicators showed that the market is rebounding from Oversold conditions. Momentum Indicators highlight the Bearish pressure, yet show it weakening through the Short term. KST values verify that the outflow over multiple time frames is Oversold.\n\nTrend Indicators signal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, confirming Consolidation as well. Bollinger Bands are beginning to tighten again while our ADX values remain HIGH through both Short and Long term, meaning that the current market is under immense pressure to move in either direction. The price is hovering around the Supertrend level and has made it ABOVE our 12-Day EMA, meaning this is the first signal we can check off as a stabilization benchmark.\n\nVolatility remains elevated while the price is rising back ABOVE the LOW Bands of our Donchian and Keltner. This too confirms the price is recovering from Oversold conditions. Volume Indicators show that inflows are beginning to run through the entire Sell wall with increasing Buy Volume, yet underlying Sell pressure is due to more money flowing out of the market than in from the profit-taking. This implies an overall indecisive investor psychology.\n\nSentiment Indicators reveal that distribution and increased Volatility have begun to test the limits of our current investors. With the current Trend cycle struggling to overcome Sell pressure, the PVT has weakened again, signaling that investors are losing confidence in price movements. News articles did well to highlight the diversity in the market, with articles about the proactive efforts by the Shiba Inu team to encourage investors, develop the ecosystem, and manage supply issues, which are positive steps towards sustained growth. Yet, whale activity combined with the significant market Volatility is creating investor skepticism which shouldn't be overlooked.\n\nIt would seem that we are at an interesting crossroads where the price wants to follow the historical March Trend, yet external market factors are placing pressure, leading to Downtrend cycles. I don't expect this Bullish and Bearish Momentum to find a winner outright through the Short term. Everything implies that we should continue to see price declines with Short term Consolidations the same way we have seen over the past 24 hours. When the price gets low enough, it leads to investors rushing into positions due to the attractiveness of those price levels.\n\nLong term Support and Resistance do no better in explaining the current market, as the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô and ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô have tightened the Neutral zone so much so that the Neutral zone is nearly non-existent. The Neutral major pivot point is pressed into the ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô at $0.00001360. That means that our Neutral major pivot point is going to be our MAX potential for the day as the market will try to recapture the Neutral zone. At LOWEST, the price will reach down to our 13-Week LOW at $0.00001170, but this will only pick up increased Buy Volume for quick reversals should we dip BELOW the top of the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô at the 1st standard price deviation at $0.00001210. So think of the range from the top of the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô all the way down to that 13-Week LOW as a reversal range due to the attractiveness of LOW prices.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help. Make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.\n\nPetition:\n\nhttps://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition",

At LOWEST, the price will reach down to our 13-Week LOW at $0.00001170, but this will only pick up increased Buy Volume for quick reversals should we dip BELOW the top of the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô at the 1st standard price deviation at $0.00001210. So think of the range from the top of the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô all the way down to that 13-Week LOW as a reversal range due to the attractiveness of LOW prices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support.

Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nThere's the pullback we were waiting for, but to see it aligned with the rest of the market is definitely not a natural thing. Momentum Indicators signal that the pullback was so extreme that it immediately reached Oversold conditions, and the Strong Bullish Momentum then entered a period of market indecision. The positive here is that despite how sharp the Downtrend was, it was still weaker than the Bullish Uptrend pressure. KST shows that the Bulls gave it better than the Bears!\n\nTrend Indicators reveal that the price has slipped far BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, and Bollinger Bands have expanded in a wide range. With the price so far BELOW the Supertrend and all EMAs, and with a Short term ADX value of 69.90, it means that the current Trend has already reached MAX strength and will only lead to Consolidation from here. This is the same concept with gains, you have to Consolidate the losses. Volatility Indicators highlighted explosive growth in Volatility to test the Bullish range of our norms, while the price is so far BELOW our Volatility Bands that everything about the price screams Oversold currently.\n\nVolume Indicators still highlight that we have positive inflows in greater volume than the outflows, yet in the Short term, it was enough to weaken the market, entering a negative Neutral phase. Sentiment Indicators signal the indecision over the market, as the previous Uptrend was placed us into a positive PVT cycle, yet the distribution in the Short term has drastically changed our current Trend cycle. Everything about this is just unnatural. News articles did well to stay focused on the whale sell-offs and market manipulation tactics that they were seeing as well. Some articles highlighted the positive aspects of the Shiba Inu ecosystem while also touching on the fact that the Shiba Inu team has been proactive in communicating and maintaining trust, which seems to be strengthening the investor loyalty overall.\n\nGiven the signs of Strong Bearish Downtrend pressure, the market will need to contend with this sudden change, which will affect our investor Sentiments because it's just not the most secure environment for more conservative investors. That's an issue where anyone that likes to investigate wallet addresses, I would recommend examining the history of the past 24 to 48 hours. It won't be hard to identify this group. My gut tells me that we will continue to see some decline, which should approach psychological Support levels rather than logical averages. We will need to Consolidate at some point, and I feel like the market needs to stabilize immediately, or Consolidation may be short and we might see another sharp decline. If this happens, it will test the patience and trust of many investors, leading to an environment where only a few hands control an entire industry.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances show that the market is attempting to hold at the midway point of the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô around the 3rd standard price deviation at $0.00001280. At LOWEST, we have the potential to touch our 52-Week LOW at $0.00001080. At MAX, the price will stabilize, and we will reach back up to the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001380.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help.

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nWell, I've been peeking at the charts throughout the day as I was working outside in the yard, and what an Uptrend! *cough* *cough* manipulation *cough* *cough*. Momentum Indicators are showing Strong Bullish values, but these are reaching Overbought benchmarks already. Trend Indicators highlight that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, with Bollinger Bands beginning to tighten again while Volatility decreases. The price is ABOVE our Supertrend and all EMAs, holding a Short term ADX value indicating Strong Trend strength underlying the current market. With Volatility decreasing, we'll see stable price movements, yet due to the pressure against our HIGH Bands of the Volatility ranges, this supports Overbought conditions.\n\nVolume Indicators offer some mixed insights, with the Short term balance showing that profit-taking seems to be the only struggle against the Uptrend. We can see a thousand percent increase in Long term Volume combined with the MFI showing that the two pressures are just now reaching Neutral ground rather than Long term Overbought. More money has begun to flow into the market than out!\n\nSentiment Indicators reveal Strong accumulation, with a new Bullish Trend cycle beginning to show that the current Buy pressure has already nearly halved the previous negative PVT cycle we were falling into. That's quite a lot of ground to claw back very quickly, and a market entering an overextension phase typically experiences a pullback to Consolidate the gains. News articles were optimistic overall, yet they are attempting to capture the investors' sentiment, which is leading to no real news other than to highlight in consensus that the market is at a pivotal point.\n\nWith the ability of our Buy pressure to overcome the Sell pressure and enter into an Uptrend with underlying Bullish pressure supporting price movements, I would expect that we experience a Bullish continuation heading into tomorrow, where we should hit some psychological barriers for some of our cautious investors. The expected Consolidation phase will be a healthy pause as investors gauge the market.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances show that the price has reached its Long term Neutral major pivot point at our 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001480. Given the underlying Buy pressure, I would see that our next MAX potential is to rise ABOVE the ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô to attempt to reach our 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001660. Think about footsteps in snow‚Äîwe are retracing our steps from the past couple weeks. At the LOWEST, the price will pull back if Sell pressure rapidly increases, down to touch the top of the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô at $0.00001380.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help. Make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.\n\nPetition:\n\nhttps://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition",

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;#39;ve been peeking at the charts throughout the day as I was working outside in the yard, and what an Uptrend! &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt; manipulation &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt;. Momentum Indicators are showing Strong Bullish values, but these are reaching Overbought benchmarks already. Trend Indicators highlight that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, with Bollinger Bands beginning to tighten again while Volatility decreases. The price is ABOVE our Supertrend and all EMAs, holding a Short term ADX value indicating Strong Trend strength underlying the current market. With Volatility decreasing, we&amp;#39;ll see stable price movements, yet due to the pressure against our HIGH Bands of the Volatility ranges, this supports Overbought conditions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Volume Indicators offer some mixed insights, with the Short term balance showing that profit-taking seems to be the only struggle against the Uptrend. We can see a thousand percent increase in Long term Volume combined with the MFI showing that the two pressures are just now reaching Neutral ground rather than Long term Overbought. More money has begun to flow into the market than out!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sentiment Indicators reveal Strong accumulation, with a new Bullish Trend cycle beginning to show that the current Buy pressure has already nearly halved the previous negative PVT cycle we were falling into. That&amp;#39;s quite a lot of ground to claw back very quickly, and a market entering an overextension phase typically experiences a pullback to Consolidate the gains. News articles were optimistic overall, yet they are attempting to capture the investors&amp;#39; sentiment, which is leading to no real news other than to highlight in consensus that the market is at a pivotal point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the ability of our Buy pressure to overcome the Sell pressure and enter into an Uptrend with underlying Bullish pressure supporting price movements, I would expect that we experience a Bullish continuation heading into tomorrow, where we should hit some psychological barriers for some of our cautious investors. The expected Consolidation phase will be a healthy pause as investors gauge the market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long term Support and Resistances show that the price has reached its Long term Neutral major pivot point at our 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001480. Given the underlying Buy pressure, I would see that our next MAX potential is to rise ABOVE the ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô to attempt to reach our 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001660. Think about footsteps in snow‚Äîwe are retracing our steps from the past couple weeks. At the LOWEST, the price will pull back if Sell pressure rapidly increases, down to touch the top of the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô at $0.00001380.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they&amp;#39;re the most important to you in the world. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The petition still needs your help.

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nCharts are showing some conditions which are kind of difficult to put into words, so we'll try to break this down with the Indicator Classes to understand the current market.\n\nMomentum Indicators are showing some struggles, as the current Trend is lacking Strong Momentum in either direction, which signifies that we are sliding into a Short term phase of Consolidation. This Buy pressure is enough to stave off the profit-taking and distribution, yet an underlying Sell pressure over multiple time frames holds the market in an overall Bearish phase of Consolidation.\n\nTrend Indicators reveal that the price is BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, the Supertrend, and all EMAs, while ADX signals that this Bearish pressure is beginning to weaken. Bollinger Bands are beginning to tighten again as Volatility decreases. Volatility Indicators show that price movements are becoming more stable as Volatility Bands support Consolidation.\n\nVolume Indicators show that Sell pressure has reached its peak and will eventually run out of steam if the Buy pressure maintains its current pace. This could set the stage for a Bullish reversal, but looking at MFI and CMF, there's still more money flowing out of the market than in. The healthy signal, however, is that the Oversold benchmark is showing through with MFI, while the CMF is showing an increasing value, meaning that the Buy pressure is enough to hold the market in this Consolidation currently.\n\nSentiment Indicators highlight that there's some increasing optimism throughout the market, with distribution finding an even pressure between Sellers and Buyers. We are currently set in a Neutral Trend cycle, yet the outflows placed an immense amount of pressure on the overall PVT value, meaning there's a lot of ground to claw back through. News articles highlighted the HIGH Volatility and rapid developments for Shiba Inu. While supply reduction efforts and ecosystem upgrades offer promising avenues for growth, the presence of critical warnings and Bearish long term Signals tempers the Long term confidence for investors entering the market.\n\nConsidering the level of distribution lingering through the Short term, the current market needs to hold Buy support to counteract and capture these positions for the market to advance back into some of the previous higher price levels we were experiencing over the weeks prior. I'm not quite sure that the underlying Sell pressure is ready to let up entirely, so I can see that this Consolidation phase might run the price sideways through today. This is an attractive price level for investors, so we might have some mild decline, but this would only strengthen Buyer interest and lead to very Short term reversal fluctuations within a tight range. Expect continuation of Consolidation, though.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances signal that the price is testing the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô, currently holding at the 2nd standard price deviation. At LOWEST, if the price struggles, we may attempt to touch our 13-Week LOW at $0.00001170. This price point aligns with the bottom of the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô at the 3rd level pivot point at $0.00001160. Should Buy pressure strengthen over the current Sell pressure levels, the market would attempt to reach the 9-Day moving average at $0.00001460 at the HIGHEST. The market is held within the Long term range of the 52-Week LOW at $0.00001080 all the way up to the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW at $0.00001480.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help.

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Charts are showing some conditions which are kind of difficult to put into words, so we&amp;#39;ll try to break this down with the Indicator Classes to understand the current market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Momentum Indicators are showing some struggles, as the current Trend is lacking Strong Momentum in either direction, which signifies that we are sliding into a Short term phase of Consolidation. This Buy pressure is enough to stave off the profit-taking and distribution, yet an underlying Sell pressure over multiple time frames holds the market in an overall Bearish phase of Consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trend Indicators reveal that the price is BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, the Supertrend, and all EMAs, while ADX signals that this Bearish pressure is beginning to weaken. Bollinger Bands are beginning to tighten again as Volatility decreases. Volatility Indicators show that price movements are becoming more stable as Volatility Bands support Consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Volume Indicators show that Sell pressure has reached its peak and will eventually run out of steam if the Buy pressure maintains its current pace. This could set the stage for a Bullish reversal, but looking at MFI and CMF, there&amp;#39;s still more money flowing out of the market than in. The healthy signal, however, is that the Oversold benchmark is showing through with MFI, while the CMF is showing an increasing value, meaning that the Buy pressure is enough to hold the market in this Consolidation currently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sentiment Indicators highlight that there&amp;#39;s some increasing optimism throughout the market, with distribution finding an even pressure between Sellers and Buyers. We are currently set in a Neutral Trend cycle, yet the outflows placed an immense amount of pressure on the overall PVT value, meaning there&amp;#39;s a lot of ground to claw back through. News articles highlighted the HIGH Volatility and rapid developments for Shiba Inu. While supply reduction efforts and ecosystem upgrades offer promising avenues for growth, the presence of critical warnings and Bearish long term Signals tempers the Long term confidence for investors entering the market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Considering the level of distribution lingering through the Short term, the current market needs to hold Buy support to counteract and capture these positions for the market to advance back into some of the previous higher price levels we were experiencing over the weeks prior. I&amp;#39;m not quite sure that the underlying Sell pressure is ready to let up entirely, so I can see that this Consolidation phase might run the price sideways through today. This is an attractive price level for investors, so we might have some mild decline, but this would only strengthen Buyer interest and lead to very Short term reversal fluctuations within a tight range. Expect continuation of Consolidation, though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long term Support and Resistances signal that the price is testing the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô, currently holding at the 2nd standard price deviation. At LOWEST, if the price struggles, we may attempt to touch our 13-Week LOW at $0.00001170. This price point aligns with the bottom of the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô at the 3rd level pivot point at $0.00001160. Should Buy pressure strengthen over the current Sell pressure levels, the market would attempt to reach the 9-Day moving average at $0.00001460 at the HIGHEST. The market is held within the Long term range of the 52-Week LOW at $0.00001080 all the way up to the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW at $0.00001480.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they&amp;#39;re the most important to you in the world. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The petition still needs your help.
