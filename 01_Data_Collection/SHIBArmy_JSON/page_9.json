          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nOptimism prevails with our current investors 'throwing out a ringer for a ringer' despite decreased whale activity by accumulating all through the dip! Momentum Indicators show that Buy pressure has strengthened enough to begin lifting the overall Trend into a new cycle of appreciation. With Sell pressure underlying the market, we need to look at our Trend indicators to understand the KST value. Trend Indicators show that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, and Bollinger Bands are beginning to expand. Remember I mentioned Bollinger Bands and Volatility, so we were expecting something to happen, and look at the Indicators‚Äîsomething is happening! We can see that the price is rising ABOVE all EMAs, attempting to establish ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô. We rest right around the Supertrend level, which is a gauge for Short and Long term Trend health. \n\nLooking at Volatility shows that we are beginning to see increases, which is now entering the Neutral of our Volatility norms range. This indicates that price fluctuations will begin to move in a wider range. Volume Indicators are now beginning to signal that the Buyers are accumulating and are outpacing strategic Sell positions. More money has begun to flow into the market than out, and the added benefit is that our MFI reveals that we have plenty of room for price appreciation before reaching Overbought. \n\nSentiment Indicators highlight the accumulation entering the market with signs that the positive price Trend is strengthening over the previous Downtrend values. When you see the negative KST and PPO values accompanying Strong Bullish Indicators, it means that the market is still running Bullish, but it's weakened in a Short term Consolidation of the gains for the current Uptrend cycle. Essentially, we're Bullish but just not as Bullish as we were a few hours ago‚Äîkind of thing. It's comparing two Bullish time periods against themselves.\n\nI want to be bold and stand on my words here. In my honest opinion, I believe that Shiba Inu has entered a new positive Trend cycle, and this is the earliest beginning of the ALTCOIN season. It is my recommendation to feel a little more comfortable and start structuring your investing plan with clear limits and find an entry you are comfortable with during the dip of the day. If the price maintains above the 200-Day EMA, this will be the signal that ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô has been reinvigorated.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances shows that the current market is breaking down the ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô, resting at this nice little stall point around the 9-Day moving average. With underlying signs of accumulation and positive price Trend Volume, at MAX, the price will attempt to reach up to our 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001740. At LOWEST, if the price attempts to Consolidate, we will reach back down to that Neutral major pivot point which coincides with our 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001530.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help. Make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.\n\nPetition:\n\nhttps://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition",

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nI took the day off and was really excited to analyze the global noons, and it looks like we're finally beginning to enter a Bullish phase. Momentum Indicators are beginning to show strengthening values with Buyers gaining control of the market. Trend Indicators signal that this Strong Short term Uptrend is riding within the Ichimoku Cloud. These are signs of Bullish Consolidation as the Trend Indicators are acting as our Short term Support/Resistance levels. The price struggling against our EMA levels with tightening Bands indicates further breakout potential. We maintain HIGH Short term ADX values, which indicates that the current Trend strength is Strong.\n\nVolatility Indicators reveal that the price is moving with small fluctuations with tightening Volatility Bands as the price approaches the LOWEST levels of Support. Volume Indicators highlight the continued underlying Sell pressure but with values showing that more money is beginning to flow into the market than out as Sell pressure Indicators are weakening. Sentiment Indicators cover this market quite well. News Sentiment was increasingly optimistic with Strong price predictions and technical analysis to identify significant Resistance levels ahead. This adds mixed levels of caution and optimism to market participants and investors entering the market. Though we can see that accumulation has placed enough pressure to reverse the previous Downtrend, running it into the Neutral Trend cycle, which has weakened the overall PVT with Bullish Buy pressure. \n\nWith the Sell pressure lingering in the market and increasing Buy pressure signals, I would expect a Bullish continuation of the current Uptrend, with the EMAs and Fibonacci retracements acting as our Resistance benchmarks for Short and Long term. If Buy pressure fails to break through some of our benchmark Resistances, then we may enter a period of Consolidation where the price would run sideways within the Bollinger Bands acting as the Trend Support and Resistance walls.\n\nLooking through Long term Support and Resistances reveals that we have approached the LOWEST point for the day at the midway point of our ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô at the 2nd level pivot point $0.00001520. Momentum should build back up, and I could see the price reaching up to the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week high at $0.00001740 at MAX over the next 24 to 48 hours.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help.

Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.\n\nPetition:\n\nhttps://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition",

Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nLooks like the Uptrend is struggling due to Strong signs of profit-taking throughout the market. Some of this downward pressure seems suspicious as whales are exiting their positions right as the market was becoming optimistic. It seems that there is an effort to hold the price down or to cause some doubt, and I would suspect that without somebody calling it out, they're going to try to bring the price down and load back up.\n\nThe Momentum Indicators show that the price is still moving with enough Bullish Momentum to keep positive pressure in the market across multiple time frames, which is a sign that Buyers are in Weak control of the market still. Trend Indicators have the price within the Ichimoku Cloud while Bollinger Bands are beginning to tighten. Combine this with the Short term ADX value showing Strong Trend strength means that the price is ready to test key EMA Resistances. We rest just ABOVE the Supertrend level, which is a positive signal that despite Sell pressure, we are maintaining the Uptrend.\n\nVolatility is declining, which means less price fluctuations in either direction. Volume Indicators highlight the Sell pressure counteracting the current Trend, as profit-taking is keeping more money flowing out than in, potentially reaching its own underlying Oversold condition. Sentiment values show that News articles are beginning to become pessimistic towards the outlook of the market, but this is due to their perception of whale activity. \nWhen I see that we have developments in the ecosystem which are being received positively and increased account holders, it signals that we should be experiencing more Uptrend pressure.That's why I call out the whale manipulation. The market was in a great place through November coming into December and never should have dipped, but whale manipulation keeps pulling the market down by loading up and offloading in this constant cycle, which is placing psychological pressure against any Uptrend. This is quite unfair in my opinion, but that is the brutal truth of being an investor. Either you know what you're doing or someone else does, and they're going to take advantage of it. We have inexperienced investors that don't understand the cycles, and with the Strong signs of distribution across the market, it means that the whales are winning.\n\nGiven the dual pressures building in the market, I would expect that we continue our current Uptrend until we Consolidate to establish a new Neutral Support range. Long term Support and Resistance reveal that the ranges have reset with the new Neutral major pivot point being right there with the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW at $0.00001530 to $0.00001540. We should try to break down the ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô through today a little bit, making it up to a MAX around the 9-Day moving average at $0.00001600. Should the market react to the profit-taking with increased FUD and rush to Sell positions the price will dip down into the midway point of the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô around the 1st standard price deviation at $0.00001470 at LOWEST.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help.

Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nThis is quite a resilient Neutral ground with the division between Bearish pressures and Bullish optimism beginning to show greater breakdown as Buyers slowly take control of the market. In the Short term, Buy pressure was able to shift Momentum Indicators with RSI showing the beginnings of a Bullish reversal. When you look at Bullish Momentum building through CMO values, you can combine KST to see that Bearish pressure is weakening. Trend Indicators show the price is within the Ichimoku Cloud, signaling a Short period of Consolidation and indecision. With the Bollinger Bands tightening and the price rising ABOVE the HIGH Band combined with HIGH Short term ADX values, it means that the market is attempting to reverse the Downtrend. This could potentially be the start of a recovery phase.\n\nThe price hovers ABOVE the Supertrend with Short term attempts to begin breaking down our EMA Resistances, starting with the 12-Day where we seem to be using this as a Neutral Support benchmark. Volatility is falling with breakout pressure building, which is calm before the storm. With Volatility Indicators showing LOW values, it means that price movements will still be stable.Volume Indicators signal that Bearish Sell pressure may have reached the peak of outflows, with the weakening sign that more money is still flowing out of the market than in, but this is declining. MFI shows this as a Neutral ground between Buy and Sell pressures currently.\n\nSentiment Indicators show that the News is a little torn here. They usually like to play it safe and not draw the ire of crypto enthusiasts. Despite the lack of positive or rather any support for the current Trend, we can still see signs of positive accumulation beginning to create a positive Trend cycle through the Short term. Given that we lack Strong Buy interest as indicated by our Volume Indicators, I would expect that without increasing Buyer support, we should continue, instead of a Bearish moving market, to be a slow-moving Bullish Consolidation to recapture Neutral Support levels. We're still waiting for Buyers to step forward and act as the catalyst for reinvigorating ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances show that the price has appreciated back into the Neutral zone just BELOW the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001540. This Neutral range is being tightened as the ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô and ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô press into each other, which is a sign of impending breakout or breakdown. Should the price break down, at LOWEST it's going to find its way to the midway point of the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô around the 3rd standard price deviation at $0.00001410. If we see increasing Buy pressure which leads to breakout appreciation, we would find the Max height before a pullback to Consolidate gains at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001670.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help.

Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nBearish Consolidation is persistent, with Sell pressure greatly influencing price movements. I do see subtle signs of potential stabilization developing. The capitulation of ‚ÄòGroup B‚Äô is beginning to add weight to the Downtrend as Momentum Indicators signal that the RSI is hovering in a Neutral Bearish zone. STC and KST highlighting the stability of the downtrend, means oscillations are beginning to stabilize.\n\nTrend Indicators show that the price is BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, the Supertrend, and all EMAs. Though, Short and Long term ADX values reveal the Bearish pressure is weakening. Volatility Indicators highlight again a subtle increase in Volatility movements, meaning price movement should fluctuate with greater range as we are approaching the LOW of our Donchian and Keltner Bands. Volume Indicators signal that Short term Volume increases gave the opportunity for increased profit-taking. In turn, this allowed Sellers Short term control of the market, with more money flowing out than in.\n\nSentiment Indicators highlight Strong distribution but with little impact to PVT values. This means that our Downtrend is a Short but Strong Sell pressure. This is truly a building pivotal point for the market to maintain this current position. With the signals still remaining Weak, I would expect that our stabilization and rebound are delayed from previous projections. Investors need to build confidence to enter at lower price levels before we can definitively pin down how far into the Short term to expect recovery. For now, I would expect we continue to see this Bearish Trend running with psychological pressures to test some of our Support and Resistance ranges. It'll look Bearish and then it'll look Bullish, but overall we will end up back in the same spot without some form of catalyst to reignite ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô.\n\nLooking through Long term Support and Resistances shows that we are right about where I expected us to be, as far as dipping down into the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô, touching on that midway level. I don't expect us to go much lower, as lower prices tend to generate Buy Volume as investors see value. That can also increase the chance of Strong pullbacks due to profit-taking, as oftentimes a Sentiment shift can trigger a FUD/FOMO Sell wave. Given these dynamics, when we do experience our recovery, for the foreseeable future, the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001670 is a MAX benchmark for our current Trend. When the market has enough Buy pressure to maintain Support ABOVE the 38.2% retracement level, we will experience accelerated price appreciation due to ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô. Until then, that is where I'm capping the market until we meet the Buy Volume requirements.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support.

          "selftext": "Good evening everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nCharts!!!... How you doing?! üòé\n\nLooks as if the psychological pressure has started to settle throughout the market after providing extended support to the Bearish Consolidation. Momentum Indicators highlighted the underlying Consolidation of the market well. RSI values showing Neutral, combined with Bullish STC oscillations, equals overall Sell pressure. This Sell pressure can be observed with the KST value, which signals that despite Sell pressure in the market and price depreciation, it's a Weak amount of Bearish pressure over multiple time frames.\n\nMomentum Indicators show the Bearish side of the Consolidation with the price BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, Supertrend, and all EMAs. These Indicators combined with Short and Long ADX values both ABOVE 30 means that this Consolidation is being held down by profit-taking, which is equivalent to what ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô would look like if we were positive, but is acting with enough counterbalancing accumulation, it's holding the market in a Neutral.\n\nVolatility barely increased, which implies that the current Trend is approaching a pivotal crossroads. We can see that despite the psychological pressures and the profit-taking, we have price-volume Trends which signal that Buyers are in a positive position with more money flowing into the market than out.\n\nSentiment Indicators highlight this Bearish Consolidation with News Sentiment beginning to provide more coverage today than the past few days. These articles seem to do well at capitalizing on the market movements to draw attention from readers. You can't blame them; that's kind of their job. If there's news, they are the news, so they need to report it. Most of the reporting was about some of the underlying market uncertainty. Essentially, we're seeing a clash of Bullish developments with Bearish realities, which is creating a complex market environment. Our investor Sentiment is divided, but there still remains signs of Strong Bullish accumulation despite the Downtrend running sideways.\n\nI still expect us to continue running sideways with some Bearish Momentum as Sellers attempt to take control of the market. This is ‚ÄòGroup A‚Äô and ‚ÄòGroup B‚Äô again. ‚ÄòGroup A‚Äô was quite pleased with the market and is more apt to enter Long positions and snag the dip, whereas our ‚ÄòGroup B‚Äô investors just experienced all of this past week, and when the price gets up there, they are ready to bounce and take profit.\n\nThe Sellers won't win this one out even if a few whales jump ship. The ecosystem is in place for Strong underlying health to keep us from depreciating much further. This is the benefit of our burn mechanism. I do expect to see a Bullish reversal through this Consolidation over the next 24 to 48 hours.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances are signaling a reset of our ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô and ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô ranges. The price has slipped into that new Neutral range BELOW the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001610. At LOWEST, with as much psychological pressure as I'm seeing in the charts, we could reach down to a favorite of the market at the midway point of our ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô at the 2nd level pivot point at $0.00001450. Looking ahead to some of our recovery expectations, the price wants to be established at that 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW at $0.00001670 at MAX.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help.

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good evening everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Charts!!!... How you doing?! üòé&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looks as if the psychological pressure has started to settle throughout the market after providing extended support to the Bearish Consolidation. Momentum Indicators highlighted the underlying Consolidation of the market well. RSI values showing Neutral, combined with Bullish STC oscillations, equals overall Sell pressure. This Sell pressure can be observed with the KST value, which signals that despite Sell pressure in the market and price depreciation, it&amp;#39;s a Weak amount of Bearish pressure over multiple time frames.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Momentum Indicators show the Bearish side of the Consolidation with the price BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, Supertrend, and all EMAs. These Indicators combined with Short and Long ADX values both ABOVE 30 means that this Consolidation is being held down by profit-taking, which is equivalent to what ‚ÄòPrice Action‚Äô would look like if we were positive, but is acting with enough counterbalancing accumulation, it&amp;#39;s holding the market in a Neutral.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Volatility barely increased, which implies that the current Trend is approaching a pivotal crossroads. We can see that despite the psychological pressures and the profit-taking, we have price-volume Trends which signal that Buyers are in a positive position with more money flowing into the market than out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sentiment Indicators highlight this Bearish Consolidation with News Sentiment beginning to provide more coverage today than the past few days. These articles seem to do well at capitalizing on the market movements to draw attention from readers. You can&amp;#39;t blame them; that&amp;#39;s kind of their job. If there&amp;#39;s news, they are the news, so they need to report it. Most of the reporting was about some of the underlying market uncertainty. Essentially, we&amp;#39;re seeing a clash of Bullish developments with Bearish realities, which is creating a complex market environment. Our investor Sentiment is divided, but there still remains signs of Strong Bullish accumulation despite the Downtrend running sideways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I still expect us to continue running sideways with some Bearish Momentum as Sellers attempt to take control of the market. This is ‚ÄòGroup A‚Äô and ‚ÄòGroup B‚Äô again. ‚ÄòGroup A‚Äô was quite pleased with the market and is more apt to enter Long positions and snag the dip, whereas our ‚ÄòGroup B‚Äô investors just experienced all of this past week, and when the price gets up there, they are ready to bounce and take profit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Sellers won&amp;#39;t win this one out even if a few whales jump ship. The ecosystem is in place for Strong underlying health to keep us from depreciating much further. This is the benefit of our burn mechanism. I do expect to see a Bullish reversal through this Consolidation over the next 24 to 48 hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long term Support and Resistances are signaling a reset of our ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô and ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô ranges. The price has slipped into that new Neutral range BELOW the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001610. At LOWEST, with as much psychological pressure as I&amp;#39;m seeing in the charts, we could reach down to a favorite of the market at the midway point of our ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô at the 2nd level pivot point at $0.00001450. Looking ahead to some of our recovery expectations, the price wants to be established at that 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW at $0.00001670 at MAX.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they&amp;#39;re the most important to you in the world. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The petition still needs your help.

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nSentiment definitely reigns king. The pullback following Consolidation pressed further than expected. Momentum indicators show the RSI at 35.30 as an early sign of Oversold conditions. With Sell pressure spread across multiple time frames through the Consolidation, the Trend weakened rather than recovered.\n\nTrend Indicators have the price BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, Supertrend, and all EMAs. With ADX Short values showing Strong Trend strength, this Oversold condition is approaching peak Downtrend. Interestingly, this tightened our Bollinger Bands. This is interesting because when I look at Volatility Indicators, we have Volatility depreciation to the LOW end of our norms. This is a sign that something is about to happen. I just finished a seminar discussing Bollinger Band tightening and falling Volatility.\n\nVolume Indicators highlight Strong Short term Buy Volume all through the dips, taking every one of those positions. You can see that it did place enough pressure to begin reaching those Oversold conditions, but underlying, while everybody was leaving, more money is still flowing into the market than out.\n\nSentiment was again interesting with only five articles about Shiba Inu. Short-term traders are exiting the market, which I can see in the charts here; we may be seeing a shift in strategy from Short term to Long term accumulation. With CO values highlighting continued Weak accumulation and CCI values approaching true Oversold, the likelihood of reaching much further is unlikely. As others may be reading articles about the ‚ÄòDeath Cross‚Äô, I am looking at a chart with dip buying and accumulation right before people start cashing their tax return checks.\n\nI am still expecting a recovery in the Short term, which could extend more than just the current day. We may see some Bearish Consolidation, or we could experience, from now till Tuesday, a Bullish recovery.\n\nLong term Support and Resistances signal that we've reached around the 9-Day moving average at $0.00001590. The current Downtrend could place enough pressure on the price to reach at LOWEST down to just BELOW the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô where the 14-Day %K Stochastic should stall out, signaling truly Oversold at $0.00001530.\n\nAt MAX, the price will try to make it back into the Neutral zone ABOVE the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW $0.00001670, all the way up to the stall range where the 3-Day moving average crosses over the 10-Day moving average at $0.00001720.\n\nAn additional side note is I am a pretty private person, but I have been having some health problems for some time, and I have a procedure scheduled for tomorrow morning where I will be under anesthetics. I am just going to take it as it goes, but I will look forward to doing an analysis tomorrow. It just may not come out at the usual time. There are two time frames that I try to trade by, and my thinking doesn't have to make sense, but US Central Standard Time 9:00 a.m. and US Central Standard Time 1:30 p.m. are time frames I really enjoy analyzing.\n\nIt may be a later day, but if anything happens, my wife will reach out to all of you. I have absolutely loved helping each and every one of you. The world is full of wolves, sheep, and shepherds. SHIB was the 1st crypto I chose to analyze, and this place has become so familiar to me and I to you all.\n\nI follow a format where I post this voice-to-text between the entry saying good afternoon and then the reminder just thanking you all and telling you no bullying, but I want you to all know truly, truly, thank you and good luck!\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help.

Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.\n\nPetition:\n\nhttps://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition",

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nWhy did the farmer fall in the well?\n\nThe Consolidation of the gains is right on track with expectations. The market pushed all the way up to just BELOW truly Overbought, like I had anticipated. This is a sign that we have a healthy market.\n\nMomentum Indicators show some of the Short term pullback, with RSI values signaling the market is running the Bearish side of Consolidation. When we look at KST showing Weak Bullish values, we can see that Buy pressure was maintained over multiple time frames, which is a signal for dip buying.\n\nTrend Indicators show the price is at the Ichimoku Cloud just ABOVE the 200-Day EMA. The price still remains BELOW our Supertrend and 12-Day and 50-Day EMAs, with an ADX Short value of 46.90 combined, meaning that we're facing a Short term Sell pressure moving with average Trend strength.\n\nVolatility Indicators signal average price movements as well, with Volatility remaining at the Neutral to LOW end of our norms range. Either way the price direction decides to move, the price fluctuations will remain relatively stable in a tight range.\n\nVolume Indicators signal some of the Consolidation pressures mixing. With Long OBV highlighting the profit-taking leading into some FUD/FOMO, and then we get our Short-term which still shows decline but is a rise from the amount of depreciation we were seeing yesterday. This means that accumulation is now more than the distribution of the Short term. CMF shows exactly that, with values signaling that more money is still flowing into the market than out over multiple time frames.\n\nNews Sentiment remained optimistic, but it was an interesting pullback in coverage, as only four pure articles spoke of Shiba Inu. The rest are doing as I had mentioned in the past‚Äîthis comparison or using the Shiba Inu name in combination with a brand new MEME coin, which is just a way of piggybacking off the popularity of Shiba Inu. With there being a continued focus on whale movements and supply reduction, it seems that these are more sound than psychological. That is an encouraging Neutral element to the current Downtrend. Remaining Sentiment Indicators highlight increased accumulation and positive turning price Trends. \n\nThis is a truly Neutral market right now, which isn't that alarming given that most people aren't thinking ahead to the next couple of weeks where American taxpayers will soon be receiving their income tax returns, and they like crypto! So with the signs of accumulation that I'm seeing in the charts during all of our dips with plenty of Buy Volume to support recovery, I would expect that we continue running sideways with ever-increasing Bullish reversal signals throughout the charts before seeing a full Bullish reversal. Despite the signs that others may see Bearish dominance, I see emerging Bullish signals. If you just take chart patterns alone and stare at the chart and look at the bars‚Äîlook at the bottom wick off every one of those red bars‚Äîthe bottom of the red bar means Buyers are stepping forward while FUD/FOMO/profit-takers walk away.\n\nLooking through Long term Support and Resistances shows that we are where I discussed price movements could potentially reach that LOW around the 9-Day moving average just inside the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô. Currently, we rest right at the 1st standard price deviation at $0.00001630. We shouldn't press much lower than current levels, and as I discussed yesterday, that 9-Day moving average should be about the LOWEST before we see a stable reversal. At MAX, the price is going to reach back up there to this nice little stall range where the 3-Day moving average crosses over the 10-Day at $0.00001720.\n\nHe couldn't see that well!\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help.

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why did the farmer fall in the well?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Consolidation of the gains is right on track with expectations. The market pushed all the way up to just BELOW truly Overbought, like I had anticipated. This is a sign that we have a healthy market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Momentum Indicators show some of the Short term pullback, with RSI values signaling the market is running the Bearish side of Consolidation. When we look at KST showing Weak Bullish values, we can see that Buy pressure was maintained over multiple time frames, which is a signal for dip buying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trend Indicators show the price is at the Ichimoku Cloud just ABOVE the 200-Day EMA. The price still remains BELOW our Supertrend and 12-Day and 50-Day EMAs, with an ADX Short value of 46.90 combined, meaning that we&amp;#39;re facing a Short term Sell pressure moving with average Trend strength.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Volatility Indicators signal average price movements as well, with Volatility remaining at the Neutral to LOW end of our norms range. Either way the price direction decides to move, the price fluctuations will remain relatively stable in a tight range.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Volume Indicators signal some of the Consolidation pressures mixing. With Long OBV highlighting the profit-taking leading into some FUD/FOMO, and then we get our Short-term which still shows decline but is a rise from the amount of depreciation we were seeing yesterday. This means that accumulation is now more than the distribution of the Short term. CMF shows exactly that, with values signaling that more money is still flowing into the market than out over multiple time frames.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;News Sentiment remained optimistic, but it was an interesting pullback in coverage, as only four pure articles spoke of Shiba Inu. The rest are doing as I had mentioned in the past‚Äîthis comparison or using the Shiba Inu name in combination with a brand new MEME coin, which is just a way of piggybacking off the popularity of Shiba Inu. With there being a continued focus on whale movements and supply reduction, it seems that these are more sound than psychological. That is an encouraging Neutral element to the current Downtrend. Remaining Sentiment Indicators highlight increased accumulation and positive turning price Trends. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a truly Neutral market right now, which isn&amp;#39;t that alarming given that most people aren&amp;#39;t thinking ahead to the next couple of weeks where American taxpayers will soon be receiving their income tax returns, and they like crypto! So with the signs of accumulation that I&amp;#39;m seeing in the charts during all of our dips with plenty of Buy Volume to support recovery, I would expect that we continue running sideways with ever-increasing Bullish reversal signals throughout the charts before seeing a full Bullish reversal. Despite the signs that others may see Bearish dominance, I see emerging Bullish signals. If you just take chart patterns alone and stare at the chart and look at the bars‚Äîlook at the bottom wick off every one of those red bars‚Äîthe bottom of the red bar means Buyers are stepping forward while FUD/FOMO/profit-takers walk away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking through Long term Support and Resistances shows that we are where I discussed price movements could potentially reach that LOW around the 9-Day moving average just inside the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô. Currently, we rest right at the 1st standard price deviation at $0.00001630. We shouldn&amp;#39;t press much lower than current levels, and as I discussed yesterday, that 9-Day moving average should be about the LOWEST before we see a stable reversal. At MAX, the price is going to reach back up there to this nice little stall range where the 3-Day moving average crosses over the 10-Day at $0.00001720.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He couldn&amp;#39;t see that well!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support.

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nWell, we round off the week with a nice recovery which looks to be attempting some early Consolidation of gains. Momentum Indicators show that price movements are beginning to approach Overbought conditions, which is leading to some Short term profit-taking. Looking at KST highlights that this pullback is enough to place Weak Bearish pressure over the current Trend straining Buy pressure across multiple time frames.\n\nLooking at Trend Indicators, we can see that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, the Supertrend, and all EMAs. When you combine in a HIGH Short ADX value of 60.07, it means that we are already approaching Strong Trend strength in Overbought conditions. Volatility still shows that we are moving with relatively stable price movements, as Volatility values are still near the Neutral to LOW end of our norms range. Volume Indicators are highlighting some of that Short term profit-taking combined with the previous outflow due to FUD/FOMO, we can see that these pressures are beginning to weaken Buyers' control over the market, with more money beginning to flow out than in.\nNews Sentiment was quite optimistic about the current market conditions, with a majority of articles highlighting the momentum building in the market despite some of the broader market setbacks. I agree with the News that we are seeing some decline in large transaction volume, which comes at a time when the ecosystem is expanding and our leadership is looking to reinforce Long term confidence. We still have positive signs of accumulation, and this latest price Trend has started to weaken the Long term Bearish Trend that's developed over the past month or so. \n\nThis is a hard one to read, as I can see both sides of the argument. With Indicators showing current values, we should hold with some positive market Sentiment, which could attract some more Buyers, and we should move with some continued Bullish Momentum before truly approaching Overbought. Now, when I see that we're lacking Buy Volume to support price appreciation, and this is tethered to profit-taking which is placing pressure against the current Trend, we could see a pullback to Consolidation, which is just a healthy correction, so it shouldn't trigger too much FUD/FOMO.\n\nLooking through Long term Support and Resistances shows that we are right about that 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW, which is acting as our Neutral point currently at $0.00001670. If we can maintain Buy pressure, at MAX the price is going to try to reach up to about that 50% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH before Consolidating. If we continue with profit-taking and it leads to a decrease in Buy Volume which triggers FOMO, this psychological pressure could push the price into the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô around the 9-Day moving average at $0.00001570 at LOWEST.\n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. \n\nThe petition still needs your help. Make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.\n\nPetition:\n\nhttps://www.change.org/SHIBArmyPetition",

Now, when I see that we&amp;#39;re lacking Buy Volume to support price appreciation, and this is tethered to profit-taking which is placing pressure against the current Trend, we could see a pullback to Consolidation, which is just a healthy correction, so it shouldn&amp;#39;t trigger too much FUD/FOMO.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking through Long term Support and Resistances shows that we are right about that 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW, which is acting as our Neutral point currently at $0.00001670. If we can maintain Buy pressure, at MAX the price is going to try to reach up to about that 50% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH before Consolidating. If we continue with profit-taking and it leads to a decrease in Buy Volume which triggers FOMO, this psychological pressure could push the price into the ‚ÄòWall of Support‚Äô around the 9-Day moving average at $0.00001570 at LOWEST.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they&amp;#39;re the most important to you in the world. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The petition still needs your help.

          "selftext": "Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.\n\nWell, the charts are showing clearly that we've slipped into a Consolidation phase due to some of the underlying Sell pressure building against the Bullish Uptrend. It's a healthy Consolidation of the gains. Momentum Indicators are highlighting a lot of the Neutral ground as we can see that Sell pressure was enough to stabilize the market through the Short term. KST values signal that we still have enough Bullish Momentum over multiple time frames to hold the market through a stable Consolidation cycle.\n\nTrend Indicators have the price WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, which is a Strong Indicator for Consolidation. We can still see the price is BELOW the Supertrend or right around there with an ADX value at 68.57, which means the current Bearish Trend has already reached Strong Trend strength, and we're still riding the Neutral ground. We do have some elevation with Volatility, but again we can see that the price is WITHIN our Donchian and Keltner Bands, suggesting Neutral Consolidation.\n\nVolume Indicators highlight some of the Sell pressure through the Long and Short term, but with the MFI and CMF having Neutral values, it's not enough to bring the market down overall. Sentiment Indicators signal some caution as investors pull back from accumulation. We are at an interesting place with plenty of breakout potential through the Short term, but we will need a catalyst to help us move along.\n\nWith so much of the Sentiment being tied around whale activity and some of our Bearish Sell walls, the market uncertainty seems to be the greatest psychological pressure. Due to this rising FUD/FOMO, I would expect the market to continue through this Consolidation before finding some Buy pressure to break through the current Weak Trend. Long term Support and Resistances show that we are right there around the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001640. It seems that I have to mention that 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW resting at $0.00001670 again, but that's going to be about the MAX for the market as it would be considered knocking on the ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô.\n\nIf we find some struggles through the Short term with increases in Sell pressure from current levels, the price will likely find reversal but not before dipping down to as LOW as the midway point just BELOW the 1st level Support pivot point at $0.00001580. If the price struggles to rebound around this low point and we slip BELOW the 9-Day moving average at $0.00001570, be aware that this could be an early signal for a sharper Downtrend. \n\nAs always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life.

It seems that I have to mention that 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW resting at $0.00001670 again, but that&amp;#39;s going to be about the MAX for the market as it would be considered knocking on the ‚ÄòWall of Resistance‚Äô.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we find some struggles through the Short term with increases in Sell pressure from current levels, the price will likely find reversal but not before dipping down to as LOW as the midway point just BELOW the 1st level Support pivot point at $0.00001580. If the price struggles to rebound around this low point and we slip BELOW the 9-Day moving average at $0.00001570, be aware that this could be an early signal for a sharper Downtrend. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they&amp;#39;re the most important to you in the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The petition still needs your help.
