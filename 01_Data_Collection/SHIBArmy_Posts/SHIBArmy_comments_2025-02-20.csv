1itwwvb,CAN-SUX-IT,Good! The individual accounts hold massive amounts of Shib are the ones that do the algorithm trading. They massively manipulate the price of Shib. These accounts are the most negative aspect of owning Shib. The less of them the less manipulation. More small holders are the most positive in the long term in my humble opinion,48,1740062313.0,2025-02-20 14:38:33

1itwwvb,Vette_Guy482,"Well according to ChatGBT Bitpay i have used.   Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a popular cryptocurrency, and several companies and platforms have started accepting it as a form of payment. Here are some companies that accept SHIB:  1. **Newegg** ‚Äì An online electronics retailer. 2. **Overstock** ‚Äì A popular online furniture and home goods store. 3. **AMC Theaters** ‚Äì A major movie theater chain in the U.S. has announced that it will accept SHIB for ticket and concession purchases. 4. **Travala** ‚Äì A travel booking site that accepts SHIB for hotel bookings, flights, and more. 5. **BitPay** ‚Äì A payment processor that facilitates SHIB payments for various merchants. 6. **Twitch** ‚Äì The popular streaming platform accepts SHIB as a payment method via partnerships with BitPay.  There are also smaller businesses and online merchants that accept SHIB, but it‚Äôs still growing in terms of widespread adoption. You can also use SHIB for purchases indirectly through payment processors like BitPay or Shopify merchants that enable cryptocurrency payments.",3,1740068044.0,2025-02-20 16:14:04
