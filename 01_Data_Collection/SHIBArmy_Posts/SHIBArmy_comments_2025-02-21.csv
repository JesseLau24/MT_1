1iuxg9x,TANSIRE43YO,"STFU, no one will buy the rug pull, no more! People that bought into it. Itching to sell. It's dead. Going freaking no where. Hold this bag another 4 years MF, unless you burn more than half. Or 2 small countries adopt. That's not going to happen!",-1,1740191369.0,2025-02-22 02:29:29

1iuxg9x,NihilistHUGZ,Very much so. It is true! [Partner Announcement](https://shib.io/get-in-touch/partners/moei),2,1740195942.0,2025-02-22 03:45:42
1iuxg9x,chukronos,It is true. Legitimate sites are reporting it,1,1740197215.0,2025-02-22 04:06:55
1iuxg9x,NihilistHUGZ,"We be good! Its all apart of the cycle and it is unnerving but over 200 analysis deep and I have seen it do backflips, roll over and then shake my hand... üòÅ Its okay  The market is dealing with waves of manipulation to keep the individual tokens from taking of before 'whoever' wants them to. Basically what is happening right now is that the main line is being held back so vips can get to the front of the line before the show starts. Market makers and what not",2,1740200439.0,2025-02-22 05:00:39
1iuxg9x,NihilistHUGZ,Oh okay. You're a nasty person and whatever this hate is it is your own fault and has nothing to do with me. Did you make yourself feel better?? Got a little something off your chest??   May I recommend you look into 'Risk Management' and next time get upset at yourself for not having a trading plan and being disciplined with your money.   We dont need your advice or your whining/bitching because the 'INSERT REASON HERE' made you think we might give two shits.   If you are tired of whining then I got 7 months of doing an analysis for SHIB on my profile. Shut up and learn something or I'll block your baby bs from my posts.,1,1740196720.0,2025-02-22 03:58:40

You need to learn to trade and hone your skills.  You may not know how to make money with this asset, but whatever you feel about SHIB it doesnt matter and I mean that in a brutally honest way.  There is a cycle and you need a realistic trading plan with clear goals and set limits. The volatility can be quite overwhelming, but this is a Sentiment bound asset which requires discipline.",1,1740198143.0,2025-02-22 04:22:23
1iuxg9x,TANSIRE43YO,"Unless you show the shib community the honest truth about the excess gravity of the matter, the coin has been a rug pull design from birth,  and now they are trying to do something,  but still how many years and nothing? Too many people want to get out, and they do less to the coin? And every year they take for you participating in this this coin. You are the only ones holding this shit bag of a coin. Only the smart one left",0,1740197230.0,2025-02-22 04:07:10

1iuxg9x,NihilistHUGZ,The gravity of thile situation... yeah a top 20 crypto just closed a deal with the UAE and we are all about to be rug pulled!? Do you understand there are others here that have been here for longer than it took you to form your opinions about SHIB.  This community knows me and knows I have always been here to keep the rug from pulling. The moment it budges I would be everywhere telling everyone but not even a wiggle. Its bots and manipulation that the INDUSTRY needs to worry about.  SHIB is an established ecosystem that doesnt require you to believe anymore. It is there and whether it is the price you want or not it isnt going anywhere. I guess we could just agree that SHIB will be a nasty taste in your mouth well for as long as technology and cryptocurrencies stay relevant. Toodles!,3,1740197621.0,2025-02-22 04:13:41

1iuxg9x,TANSIRE43YO,"So, what you are telling me is that they didn't put money in, but have tokens to pull out. Because if all this money was in. It would change the price for someone else to pull out. To much manipulation! Get the fuck out this coin!!!",1,1740198160.0,2025-02-22 04:22:40
1iuxg9x,NihilistHUGZ,There is no 'pulling' anymore. That ship sailed a long time ago. I have doubled my $$ twice with SHIB so you saying it is sham makes no sense. Seriously find another coin to bash. You will be 90% right if you find a community for a MEME coin less that 1 year old. That is statistically hoe many fail withing 1st year.  How many years has SHIB been going... When rug? When can i expect the big news? I think you owe more than baseless opinions! You deserve a spot light to make your case.  I'll let you go on. Floor is yours...,2,1740199182.0,2025-02-22 04:39:42
1iuxg9x,NihilistHUGZ,"You are choosing a single asset like the issues you describe are isolated to SHIB. I know small cap coins that you have been pitched to me which cant even be touched with a $1000 before bots are alerted and suck the liquidity from that asset.  This is an issue affecting the industry and you dont find it suspicious that as the BTC price dips and liquidity sucks from the crypto industry only for institutional investors to end up scooping up an additional 26k BTC??  You're a very small fish and this isnt a rug pull. You aren't a bad person, but you have a narrow view. SHIB is fully community with 60% of the total circulation held by exchanges and whales.  Do you see Crypto.com dumping SHIB? What about Coinbase dumping SHIB?? Oh oh what about Robinhood? Did they divest?  The UAE... A government! Rugpulled? Well...",3,1740198725.0,2025-02-22 04:32:05
1iuxg9x,TANSIRE43YO,"Of course,  because I'm a fucking real mf that makes money. How much do you have invested in this this coin, so that everyone knows.",0,1740199407.0,2025-02-22 04:43:27
1iuxg9x,NihilistHUGZ,"I don't talk money like that. It is uncouth. What I will discuss is the difference in a real mf and what you are doing. Take a deep breath and listen to damn reason. This asset has been here for years. Its been tested and the ability to rug pull the project no longer exists. It is expanded to have other functional token within its ecosystem and by all means its not been all roses. The ecosystem has been updated regularly and the previoud lead developer kept his word and left shit in the community‚Äôs hands. He didnt run away but instead he went out and got a government, the UAE to adapt the token and its ecosystem.  I have been here long enough to know its not going anywhere. 7 months of analysis EVERYDAY. Over 200+ analysis! I have seen this asset in everyway it can be investigated and researched and it was all for the sole purpose of protecting my own money at first but then it became something I felt laid on my heart. I am the testament so when others come to say this will fail I can confidently say no it wont.  Lets be realistic about the $1 or the $0.01! Not for a good long while but there is a way there and SHIB is walking that path right now. It is not impossible however",2,1740200129.0,2025-02-22 04:55:29
1iuxg9x,TANSIRE43YO,"You are going for price, when it's not going to be realistic? You are Forcasting a failed project. And everyone knows. There isn't an upgrade in a price when people put, put, put, and a decline in price? Any other coin, it would go up. You are, how would you say, crying wolf, when ther is no bull or bearish market?",1,1740200746.0,2025-02-22 05:05:46
1iuxg9x,NihilistHUGZ,And you are crying what exactly? You are the 4829208483rd person to say^^^^^ sooooo..... What now? Do we kiss and make up?!,1,1740200938.0,2025-02-22 05:08:58
1iuxg9x,TANSIRE43YO,"Oh, so now you are going to forgive the people you that you miss led to buy in this shit coin, because I showed you the truth? People are probably going to inbox for compensation",1,1740201133.0,2025-02-22 05:12:13
