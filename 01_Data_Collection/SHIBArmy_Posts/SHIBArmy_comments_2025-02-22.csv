1ivqa34,NihilistHUGZ,No need it gets burned for us through the ecosystem and it is built in based on burning fees on transactions that utilize the Shibarium.  We could get more burns by finding companies to utilize the Shibarium. I have a petition for just that. The more SHIB gets utilized for payment systems the fees can be burned off if they utilize the Shibarium and that can generate massive burns to create accelerated scarcity and value.  Keep your SHIB and dont burn. Let the ecosystem burn for you. Old Ronco Cooker motto... Set it and forget it!,13,1740258223.0,2025-02-22 21:03:43

1ivqa34,NihilistHUGZ,So. It is there and it is functional. I dont need to argue thr numbers. It has the effect it has and thats what it is there for. To act a deflationary and scaricity mechanism which long term creates value. If you look at what I said then it is hypothetical but I have provided my math on this in the past and my idea is plausible and realistic.  Any discussion of the burns on the effect they have for price movements are currently irrelevant bc you are partially right. The only impactful burn was Vitalik. The burn now serves as a Sentiment driver and with this asset class Sentiment is the single greatest factor for price movements.,3,1740262390.0,2025-02-22 22:13:10

1ivjvsq,NihilistHUGZ,If you are down and you want to cut your losses then take the same amount you have or 1.5x the intial investment and find the lowest point of a dip during an upcycle and average down to reduce the overall loss.   Essentially you pay to not lose so much. Just wait for price to rise up over the 2nd investment and the gains will help stabilize your losses and then you can exit.   Its a trick i use on my losers bc I'm not perfect and I get into some situations but have learned how to turn a 20+% loss into a 4% loss or even flip to break even and sometimes end up with a smidgen of profit.   Just dont let losses cause you to capitulate to the point where you are purely emotional entering and exiting trades. Hone in on some TA and follow the charts until you can plot the entry and exit.  When you feel complacent or are looking at the asset with denial then it is time to take a step back and reasses your position.,1,1740258732.0,2025-02-22 21:12:12

1ivjvsq,AccomplishedTwist368,"It's not about what can happen with this investment alone. It's about opportunity cost and risk/reqard. What could that money earn you somewhere else?  Shib is a fairly safe investment, think store of value with some opportunity for fluctuations. If you want to make 2x-4x or whatever, it's very doable.  However, if you are seeking more of a conviction play to find a 1000x-10,000x potential, shib simply can't.    So if you pulled out your shib rn and then look a year from now to see it could have been 4x but you made 1200x on a different coin, are you going to be upset to took SHIB for a loss? Probably not.   But if you have $4M in SHIB, well that's not anything that needs to 2000x no be meaningful so you're better having some in medium risk like SHIB and some digital golds like Bitcoin and Eth",1,1740388292.0,2025-02-24 09:11:32
