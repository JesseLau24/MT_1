1iwttu7,NihilistHUGZ,"Over the past few months I have learned a vast amount of the structure for bots or algorithmic trading. They are set to identify buy and sell signals based on metrics which track several different values lile rules. A human requires years of experience to recognize these same patterns but even then there is no competition for the algorithm that identifies those same patterns to the 'value' meaning higher frequency of potential trades.  One of the greatest challenges is the frequency of these trades and keeping up with them. They also work against each other as well as many people use them. So if someone improperly sets the rules for the algorithm the consequences affects the other bots and humans in a terrible cycle.  These algorithms are set by large investors and other companies pay for these service to do everything from provide liquidity/suck liquidity, false flag dumps, market aggregates, and many other ways to benefit and harm the process movements of EVERY ASSET CLASS NOT JUST CRYPTO.  The bots dont stop at the charts they are in every forum on every platform and in every way influencing the psychology of the average investor as well.",5,1740675115.0,2025-02-27 16:51:55

1iwrq4v,NihilistHUGZ,"Oh so investment advice from someone who sold years ago. Do you think people care about your insights when you only came back after making a 3233.33% profit to drag the asset, because it hasn't repeatedly undergone those appreciative cycles for others to experience the same profit as you? Your experience is relative and not relavent due to the reality of the growth cycle for this asset. Anyone holding for a quick bag has lost focus on what a viable asset is.  The focus for many is that this asset in particular started as a MEME and has grown to real world use case and adaptations which utilize the ecosystem. This has transitioned from something you experienced to now something we are experiencing.  You can dislike SHIB but in this phase of asset class growth and evolution, sentiments and your sentiment are an issue which degrades the value of this asset that others are invested in relative to their own experience. If you want to see SHIB fail then it will be because people like yourself keep coming back to scare current investors. Hypothetically but also realistically this is becoming a long term value asset.  As long as partnerships and integrations such as the recent UAE Energy Department utilization of the SHIB ecosystem continue there is no reason to doubt the long term viability and success for others to hold SHIB in their portfolio. Not everyone holds JUST SHIB btw. Some like myself are utilization driven investors who are capturing the cryptocurrencies tied to emerging sector utilizations in what I perceive to be the greatest evolution of the global economic structure since the Industrial Revolution.",2,1740502584.0,2025-02-25 16:56:24
