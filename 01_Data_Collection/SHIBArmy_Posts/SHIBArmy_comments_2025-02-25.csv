1ixhda8,cuminghairy,Shib so far is still unstable buying at 00002 was a mistake but if you wait 3-6-9 months it‚Äôll probably hit .000025-35 again. It‚Äôs a game. So far it doesn‚Äôt show any stability. So you sell where you bought or higher and buy again at .00001 or less.,9,1740447603.0,2025-02-25 01:40:03
