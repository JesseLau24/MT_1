1iyx8so,NihilistHUGZ,"Edit: I just noticed I reversed the ADX short value with the long value so in the analysis when i say, ""it means that the Short term value is our Uptrend cycle"" that should be reversed.   Our Short term value is the current Consolidation/Bearish pressure and Long term was the trailing previous uptrend. The are mixed with pressure creating a Neutral pressure.",1,1740604058.0,2025-02-26 21:07:38
1iywl3n,Sea_Addition_1686,No it looks like most alts are holding this drop. Or bitcoin is just acting delayed and should have dropped earlier. Either way I think this is a bear trap,28,1740600296.0,2025-02-26 20:04:56

1iywl3n,NihilistHUGZ,Historically March is a great Month for SHIB. This is normal market movements due to external market factors.  https://preview.redd.it/erqtx6lxljle1.jpeg?width=1439&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b05a5c07947b8e46809ccf5248ac2bd05761d55e,17,1740601507.0,2025-02-26 20:25:07

1iywl3n,prissyemu,Itâ€™s just the end of a cycle not the end of SHIB itself check back next year or so. Iâ€™m just curious why everyone seems to think itâ€™ll hit zero? bitcoin has lost half its value multiple times shib has lost most of its value a couple times I think. Itâ€™s all speculation things that go up will come down then maybe go back up.,-1,1740600418.0,2025-02-26 20:06:58
