1j0asiz,CAN-SUX-IT,No! Absolutely not! Only assets that are completely recession proof is cold hard cash! In an economic downturn cash is king! The 3rd quarterly report in October will show that weâ€™re in a bad recession. Gather up every cent you can until October and buy back assets pennies on the dollar. The crypto world is an endless cycle of booms and crashes. Weâ€™re in a crypto boom bubble. Itâ€™s going to burst in mid July. Thatâ€™s when the second quarterly report of the orange grifters administration comes out and itâ€™s going to show that weâ€™re in a recession. The 3rd quarterly report in mid October will show itâ€™s a bad recession and getting worse.,2,1740859234.0,2025-03-01 20:00:34

1j00qmz,SteveTabs,Itâ€™s market manipulation not a Shib issue.  If you notice the market as a whole dropping or going up and the trend looks identical then thatâ€™s whatâ€™s going on by the whales.  A single coin drop/gain are the ones we need to ask the question why.,5,1740747025.0,2025-02-28 12:50:25
