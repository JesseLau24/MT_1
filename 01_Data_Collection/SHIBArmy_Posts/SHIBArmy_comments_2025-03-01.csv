1j16zgq,Kayaltar,I doubt if he created Shiba Inu,1,1740909550.0,2025-03-02 09:59:10

1j16zgq,EasyMoneyHODL,Pretty sure he is.,-4,1740856055.0,2025-03-01 19:07:35
1j16zgq,SquadGuy3,"Absolutely not, this coin is dead and has been dead for oh 3.5 years now? It may never move again. Pretty sure if it was VB, we’d of been up",-5,1740883803.0,2025-03-02 02:50:03
1j16zgq,CAN-SUX-IT,Yes you’re right. Why would Ryoshi give 50% of SHIB to Buterin for absolutely no apparent reason? No sane person would do that right?,-11,1740857675.0,2025-03-01 19:34:35
1j16zgq,CAN-SUX-IT,"He was so intrigued that the first crypto was created by a mysterious entity that never came out. Satoshi was so fascinating to Buterin, so he created his own magical fantasy with Ryoshi’s concocted story. So when he created the second crypto he wanted to copy the magic that bitcoin had. So he created Shib and Ryoshi and injected himself as a wise and kind mentor that helped in the creation of Shib. He was given half of all Shib that he allegedly destroyed 45% of all Shib and gave away the remaining 5% to a charity. To me he created Shib while he was high. Realized he had made way too much and needed to correct his mistakes so he injected himself into this fantasy and the rest is his self made fantasy/history.",0,1740930629.0,2025-03-02 15:50:29
1j16zgq,CAN-SUX-IT,Keep saying that and one day maybe you’ll even believe it!,1,1740872999.0,2025-03-01 23:49:59
1j16zgq,Phrawg-spawn,Ethereum is down,1,1741126617.0,2025-03-04 22:16:57
1j16zgq,klobbenropper,"Were you around back then? If so, you would know that 'Burned to Vitalik' was a standard marketing tactic used by many Ethereum tokens to gain attention, as Vitalik's wallet was well-known and closely watched by many.",8,1740857948.0,2025-03-01 19:39:08
1j16zgq,oh_Jiggler,"I know it is, imagine putting your money into this when there are 50 better options lol",0,1740873094.0,2025-03-01 23:51:34
1j16zgq,CAN-SUX-IT,So Vitalik is only allowed to have one single wallet? No sane person would believe that.,-8,1740858739.0,2025-03-01 19:52:19
1j16zgq,CAN-SUX-IT,You’re allowed to believe anything you want. I keep making money off SHIB. So you’re just not doing it right if you’re not up with SHIB. You’re buying high selling low I guess. But I don’t have that problem. Once you have a billion SHIB and it drops a zero. Then the bullshit others say is laughable,-3,1740873947.0,2025-03-02 00:05:47
1j16zgq,klobbenropper,"As I said, a huge number of ETH shitcoins used his wallet as a burn wallet for marketing purposes. Shiba was just the most successful one—by far. When the value suddenly soared into the billions, he had to act. And he did the only right thing: he transferred 90% to a proper burn wallet and donated the remaining 10% to a Covid fund. He is not the founder of Shiba. Period.",4,1740859155.0,2025-03-01 19:59:15
1j16zgq,oh_Jiggler,"It’ll never drop another zero, I’m still up bc I bought early, I took money out and made MORE money off stable stocks and cryptos. The ones that aren’t dead meme coins.   The vast majority of people have lost money off shib and if you keep taking profit and RE buying into shib and shib alone then you’re an idiot",2,1740874196.0,2025-03-02 00:09:56
1j16zgq,CAN-SUX-IT,Not saying it’s true or not. But this dead end wallet is only dead because Buterin says it’s dead right?,-1,1740859422.0,2025-03-01 20:03:42
1j16zgq,klobbenropper,"The structure of the address indicates that it is not a 'normal' wallet address generated from a key. Consequently, no one can have a corresponding private key, making the wallet permanently inaccessible. The transaction history supports this, as there has never been an outflow from the wallet.",3,1740860095.0,2025-03-01 20:14:55
1j16zgq,crobo777,"I had this theory a while back that its the perfect set up for a rug pull. But its doubtful, but the chances of this aren't zero.",1,1740875425.0,2025-03-02 00:30:25
1j16zgq,crobo777,Until there is. All at once. Lol,0,1740875258.0,2025-03-02 00:27:38
1j16zgq,CAN-SUX-IT,I don’t trust anyone with my bank account password. So why would I trust someone who could make a $100 million if he fooled everyone into believing that he made a crypto wallet that’s a dead end. He puts a bunch of crypto in there. Then others start putting crypto in it to so called burn it. Then a couple decades later he empties it and claims someone hacked it and stole everything. Really simple emergency retirement plan.,3,1740888957.0,2025-03-02 04:15:57
1j16zgq,klobbenropper,No. For the reasons mentioned above.,1,1740876669.0,2025-03-02 00:51:09
