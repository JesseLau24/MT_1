1j2uo5g,GoreonmyGears,Because the entire financial system is crashing due to the tariffs being implemented tonight.  Welcome to the Great depression 2.0.,58,1741040067.0,2025-03-03 22:14:27
1j2uo5g,Victorvnv,"Not really, it‚Äôs all air and nothing else .   First off putting 5-10 coins most of them centralized means there won‚Äôt be any clear direction outside random buying of coins and putting them in a wallet   Second of all most of these coins are centralized. That means that the companies behind them already have huge reserves and will likely low ball the retailers by offering huge OTC deals with discounts to the government meaning the prices are unlikely to really change and any upside will be eaten by the big bag holders selling directly to the government   As always the retailers and tax payers will be the liquidity for the already rich ones as they are the ones who hear the news the latest and are the slowest to react   Nothing good will come out of this meantime what Trump is doing with the tariffs will have immediate negative impact on everyone affected thus the market outside speculation is very bearish right now",8,1741040031.0,2025-03-03 22:13:51

1j2uo5g,Lordbogaaa,"People have to pull out money, to prepare for the increased cost of goods for the tariffs.  Which Crypto is held up by the amount of money in the coin so more people pull money out to avoid the losses in value and sell higher.  It will most likely go higher in the future.    And a Crypto Reserve isn't a terrible idea but semi pointless. Especially cause you are by the nature of spending American dollars on crypto increasing the value of the crypto while locking American dollars into the coins.  Less money in the system drives up inflation.",1,1741046926.0,2025-03-04 00:08:46

My best guess, there is some sort of financial realignment happening as areas of crypto have shown themselves to be sustainable stores of value... It almost has the same feel that 2016 had.  Make sure you have done your due diligence, diversified where you need to, and buckle up.  I'm a little surprised that shibarium has not been spoken about or even mentioned; Considering the network was established to function more efficiently (less gas fees), and supporting a native burn mechanism (well, semi-native).  A lot of noise has been highlighting the networks: ADA, SOL, XRP, and of course BTC and ETH. I've noticed Polygon has also been pretty quiet.

Similar to the successful mom & pop getting absorbed by a conglomerate, this blockchain tech was too good to go ignored. Now, we‚Äôre entering a sort of hybrid decentralization.   As much as I love the ideals of DeFi, supposedly ~94% of the population has never held crypto. No matter how much we shout, the retail adoption is relatively low. Meanwhile, Ripple Labs has been using those reserves to successfully position their blockchain to become the standard for global finance and Hedera‚Äôs partnered with the biggest public and private companies to establish their HashGraph as the highest standard for security now and against quantum.

1j26vv0,Mindless_Umpire9198,"Sadly, I never really bothered to look at my average before you asked.  Crypto.com:  47,999,792.63 @ $0.000008454 = $405.81   Coinbase:  14,727,345.29 @ $0.000013 = $191.46   Robinhood:  3,072,693 @ $0.0000185 = $56.84   ====================================   I guess that is $654.11 / 65,799,830.92 = $0.000009941 Average Cost  Thanks for making me do the math, so at least I know I'm currently not underwater across the board.
