1j3wdd7,CAN-SUX-IT,What crypto is down from it high of $15 a token to .25 cents and still falling? This bullshit post is trying to say it‚Äôs a success. It‚Äôs a complete joke and a failure. Bone is on a constant drop in value since its inception. It‚Äôs a scam that has only taken money from anyone who has ever put money in it.,1,1741745929.0,2025-03-12 02:18:49
1j3wdd7,CryptoMoneyLand,"You don't know the history of bone it seems.  The reason why bone was $15  was that when it was first minted, the supply was low. Supply and Demand.  The supply of bone was slowly increased from 0 to 250 M and then capped at 250M.  Then, when it was only like around 100 to 500 bones out there, the price was like $15.  Now that the supply is capped, it follows the rest of the market.",1,1741885131.0,2025-03-13 16:58:51
1j3wdd7,CAN-SUX-IT,It‚Äôs 25 cents on a good day! It‚Äôs not even getting any attention from anyone. It‚Äôs a failure and I get that when I bought in that I‚Äôm a bag holder.

1j3wdd7,CAN-SUX-IT,Shibarium is a bad joke. It‚Äôs a self made bogus idea that‚Äôs controlled by children who create fantasies and attempt a generate attention for themselves and pretend to work for the Shiba Inu community. I regret that I didn‚Äôt see how immature the people behind Shibarium were before I bought in. Avoid anything Shibarium related and please never by into their hype.
