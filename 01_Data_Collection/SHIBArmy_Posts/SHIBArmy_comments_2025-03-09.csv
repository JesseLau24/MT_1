Shiba still has a chance but it's designed for long term. They messed up by staring with far too many coins. Doge is designed to fail as it will end with far too many coins.

It really doesn't matter what SHIB's price does short-term, gotta look at its prospects. That's what really makes SHIB an invaluable long-term investment. It actually has real tangible prospects, and it consistently delivers on them in due time.   Dips like this just make it easier to accumulate.    I say it here all the time... treat SHIB like a retirement account and you can't go wrong.
