1j8qmsr,Mother_Childhood3887,"Had to aell off 90% but Still holding over 6k in Shib, Bone. LEASH but that being said. Their rewards are a joke.   First the whole thing with Ryoshi Vision and burns. Promising 200% in returns with Ryoshi. I burned 800$ worth of Shib got 0 rewards.  Second first time staking I earned 600 in free bone. Then it stopped. They started again staking in shibarium. I staked and then discovered out of all this time I made a whopping 28 bone....it cost me over 90$ in ETH gas fees to stake and claim. I did not even bothering claiming my bone because it would cost more. Instead just reclaimed my Bone.  On positive note. The Shib Land is finally making some traction. Bot sure why it is not letting me build my house property.  Maybe still locked. Have few lands in that so hoping they finish in next 3 years",1,1741894660.0,2025-03-13 19:37:40

Some wallets are natively integrating with Shibarium now, like Rabby Wallet.  Dapps will automatically add the Shibarium network to your wallet if it doesn't see it in there as well.

1j8qmsr,jbraden,">First the whole thing with Ryoshi Vision and burns. Promising 200% in returns with Ryoshi. I burned 800$ worth of Shib got 0 rewards.  This was before Shibarium and the core team that promoted it apologized for RV not living up to their promises. I had also burned Shib and received nothing.  >Second first time staking I earned 600 in free bone. Then it stopped. They started again staking in shibarium. I staked and then discovered out of all this time I made a whopping 28 bone  This was before Shibarium as well. The reason you got so much Bone at the start was because burying is how $Bone was minted. After the mint out, participants were only receiving transaction fees. This was a public understanding of the liquidity event.  >The Shib Land is finally making some traction. Bot sure why it is not letting me build my house property.  Maybe still locked.

1j8pha9,Mr_Lightspeed98,"Because burns are the biggest grift in crypto.  Sending to dead wallets is NOT a real burn.  The Shib smart contract does not have a legitimate burn function.  All that can be done realistically is lift the floor to send to a wallet that cannot be sold.  To truly have a price impact, the liquidity pool ratio has to be changed. Indirectly, a true burn function that permanently deducts the supply ON CHAIN can impact supply and demand indirectly.",23,1741698069.0,2025-03-11 13:01:09
1j8pha9,GoharioFTW,"Shib burned trillions... From vitalik's burn  Shib hasn't burned shit ever since relatively.  and Shibarium's low burn transactions fees *certainly* don't help either.  People really don't understand how big one BILLION is, let alone one trillion.  \--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  If you stacked **1 million** dollar bills on top of each other, the stack would be about 10,000 inches high, or roughly 833 feet tall. Which is about 2.3 football fields.  If you stacked **1 billion** dollar bills on top of each other, it would stack to about 10,000,000 inches high, or approximately 95,000 feet tall, which is roughly the height of Mount Everest.  Now... if you stacked **1 trillion** dollar bills on top of each other, it would stack to about 67,866 miles into **SPACE.** Like literally past Earth's atmosphere and into **OUTER SPACE.** This stack would be like 280 times higher than the I.S.S. cuz the space station orbits Earth at like 250 miles above.  Now... Take that stack and multiply it by FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE TIMES (**40 million miles**) and you see how burning a few tens of millions or hundreds of millions of Shib is virtually a drop in a bucket...   Cuz you'd be chipping away 20 or 200 football fields from something that's literally reaching almost halfway from the Earth to the Sun.     \*edit A drop in the bucket isn't even an applicable idiom to use here in hindsight. It's like trying to find a single grain of sand in outer space or something.",9,1741721131.0,2025-03-11 19:25:31
1j8pha9,jasikanicolepi,"It's been 3 years. Other than the 400 trillion initial burn, shib hasn't even officially burned 1 trillion. That's how bad it has been. All the initial hype has since fizzled out. The dev had every opportunity to make this great but each devs grifted for their own gain. Ryoshi, shiboshi nft, shib vr store, land, leash, bone, treat, shib fast food, shib trading card game, shib clothing chain everything have nothing but grifting by pumping out one failing project after another. Shib could have encompassed all the additional useless subsidiary token including leash, bone, and treat. But each dev wants to grift using shib's hype. Instead of focusing on one central source and focus on the mission of burning shib, they pump out all these projects that promised shib burn but did none of it. At this point shib is as good as dead.

1j8pha9,Brandine04,"It's funny that people complain about the burn. They are only burning 2.5 billion coins per year, which means that at that rate, it's a 40-year investment with a small return.   According to the shibarmy, they have 548,000 members.  If say 150,000 of those members are active and buy/sell shib and each member was to burn 10,000 to 100,000 coins per 1 million coins purchased then you would see a dramatic burn rate in the 30 to 50 billion range. When the crypto community gets wind of that, they will buy or buy and help burn, which will cause more people to buy, and both the burn and FOMO effect will cause the price to rise.  The problem is getting people who don't mind a small loss for greater gains. The funny thing is that you are going to have to pay capital gains taxes, and with no loss to offset your gains, then you feel the full hit of that 25%.

1j8pha9,SloppyxxCorn,"That's how single volume pool meme coins work - in theory. Shiba has an ecosystem of 2 coins, staking, and a governing coin, so things aren't that straightforward. Even in practice if a large volume is burned, raising the value, it is clear that the intention of a great many is to release their held volume into the market once it is profitable. So then volume is individually released, lowering the value until it is no longer profitable to each person intending to do so - a last one out is a rotten egg moment, and some will even take the losses because they just have no clue. At the end, the market returns to the same value or worse, but with less volume than before the burn. It's a destructive process that benefits whales mainly.",1,1741800123.0,2025-03-12 17:22:03

1j8k2nu,Endless-OOP-Loop,I disagree. It'll probably do a 12x surge after it plummets another 95%.,2,1741697724.0,2025-03-11 12:55:24
1j8k2nu,Extension-Lie-3272,Me too but it won't. That ATH was pump and dump sniper style. As soon as it hits 50% for me I am out. Waiting is ok but I simply see my money going further elsewhere but I see other coins like XRP and even Bonk do 500% this cycle lol.,1,1741771228.0,2025-03-12 09:20:28
