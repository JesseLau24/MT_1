1jc4g10,Mr_Lightspeed98,"  I get where you’re coming from, but the math around burning tokens isn’t quite that simple. Here’s the thing:   • Burning tokens reduces supply, but price only rises if demand stays steady or increases.  • Your analogy of burning half the world’s money wouldn’t double everyone’s wealth; it’d create panic, economic instability, and loss of trust. To make everyone twice as rich, you take that half from half the people and give it to the other half.  • Token prices rely on many factors—demand, utility, trust, and overall market conditions not just scarcity alone.  So, burning tokens can sometimes help, but it definitely doesn’t always guarantee higher value.",3,1742072819.0,2025-03-15 21:06:59
1jc4g10,Brandine04,"The burn will work at its current rate in about 60 years. If a community decided to stop crying and actually did a proper burn then they could easily wipe off billions of coins per month but sadly to many people are greedy and not willing to understand loss, capital gains and write offs. The funny part is that if enough people participated, then everyone could sacrifice as little as $1 a week.  Sadly, it will never happen because of greed and a lack of understanding.",2,1742081388.0,2025-03-15 23:29:48
1jc4g10,NihilistHUGZ,"This in general is the way it needs to be understood. You cannot use the example of burning half the world's money because there is no expectancy for our money to be burned. There is however the expectancy of a burn mechanism built into the ecosystem to function properly. The best way to think about this is in fact about the math but to expand further and add in the hypothetical expansions and utilizations.  If you had several different countries with entire sectors of industry using Shiba Inu and the ecosystem it would in turn accelerate the burn rate. Scarcity does create value outright but also the burn mechanism acts as a deflationary mechanism as well for economies that could use it as a store of value to fight other traditional asset class inflation.  Large community projects can be generated and voted upon to remove tokens in other ways but essentially the ecosystem has already built it in for a long term way to create store of value.  Greater utilization of the current ecosystems and as those ecosystems improving, will enhance utilizations as well creating a cycle which will improve the burns and so on and so forth... Long term goals!   You have to stop thinking of the now and your preconceptions of what the burn mechanism is and begin understanding the built-in aspect for the ecosystem and what that actually entails. When you understand the ecosystem then you can begin to understand the hypothetics of utilizations. It's a great thing.",1,1742074312.0,2025-03-15 21:31:52
1jc4g10,carnewsguy,It doesn’t really work that way because there is nothing underpinning the token other than someone one willing to pay for it.,1,1742075776.0,2025-03-15 21:56:16
1jc4g10,Legitimate_Ad785,"It was a good marketing gimmick for shiba, but not enough has been burned to make a difference except when the guy who created burned x amount large amount.  Also majority of shiba is own by people, no body is going to burn there shiba.",1,1742075830.0,2025-03-15 21:57:10

1jc4g10,psilon2020,Burning would have to be on the trillions to start impacting the price.  That isn't going to happen anytime soon with the very low amounts.,1,1742079930.0,2025-03-15 23:05:30
1jc4g10,daSTDbunny,"Lol, if we burned half of the world's money, they would just print more because a currency value is based on a nations GDP. It's not like there's a set amount of American dollars, and if we got rid of half of it that the dollar is valued more.   Like, have you followed the stock market?   If we burned half of the total shib and no one accepts Shib, then its value is nothing. That's the demand part of the supply that OP doesn't seem to grasp.    You don't even need to ask AI why your conception is bad.   So you're wrong because you listen to Joe Rogan.",1,1742083074.0,2025-03-15 23:57:54

1jc4g10,Merlin1039,They aren't burning something anyone is buying though. You'd have to burn it down to a supply that is less than the demand for it to matter,1,1742137324.0,2025-03-16 15:02:04
1jc4g10,deliriouz16,Burns work as I'm in a token where it's 92 percent burned and we're trading at .015 cents but we have utility to do buybacks to burn more.

1jc4g10,AlpacaSmacker,"If we burned half the world's money at once then everyone would have the same amount as they did before the burn because everyone would be on a level playing field.

Look at the raw numbers. The human mind is not built to operate with such figures. We're talking about billions of dollars in real money that would have to be spent to make a noticeable impact. That’s not going to happen.  Look to the past. 99% of the burn wallet can be traced back to a single man with one transaction. Did that transaction, which destroyed 40% of the total supply, drive the price up? No, it continued to fall in the weeks that followed.",1,1742147369.0,2025-03-16 17:49:29
