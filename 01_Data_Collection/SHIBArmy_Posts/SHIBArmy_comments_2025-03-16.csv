1jcuxfm,NihilistHUGZ,But that's why I say it sounds scammy is due to the fact that the eip-1559 protocol built into the SHIB ecosystem already offers the ability for users to transparently see the accumulation of BONE which dictates when the burn can happen after BONE reaches a point of 100 being accumulated. Right now it's averaging out to a little over 12 million SHIB once that BONE is converted but anyone with a wallet that contains she but Inu can connect to the ecosystem and initiate a burn when they see it's over 100. Also there are groups in the ecosystem which you can Bridge your Shiba Inu tokens 2 and they will initiate Burns based upon Community input.  Scorch is trying to do something that already exists and that is like saying when I go to the bathroom Scorch will be there to wipe my booty for me. I can do that myself and the ecosystem Shiba Inu has which utilizes the EIP-1559 protocol gives me the ability manually as well as other bridged groups.   I just really want you to consider how it sounds. Scorch wants a person to sign up so that they can initiate a burn for you or provide a community for Shiba Inu to burn Shiba Inu when you can already do that yourself. It sounds to me like Scorch is a new token that is trying to capitalize on the existing successful community and gather users to think that it's going to generate more burns when in fact it will not generate any more than the ecosystem already allows and because of the way the development team created the burn mechanism so BUILT-IN Scorch is redundant so even if it is really it will fail because the utilization makes no long term sense and when investors realize the redundancy it will lose positive sentiment and fail within one year.,2,1742158899.0,2025-03-16 21:01:39

If you take as a hypothetical future base valuation for SHIB and the ecosystem the current valuation of BTC the burns could be extremely impactful to cost and scarcity. Think about this:   If SHIB has a market cap of $7.77 billion and 123330500 tokens are burned upon each 100 BONE it works out like this   12330500 / $7770000000 = 0.001586 tokens burned roughly per day per $ of market cap   Now lets factor that down with BTC by market caps   1.65 / 7.77 = 0.2122 proportionally  0.2122 * 1000 = 212.2 factor rate  212.2 * 12330500 = 2616532100 future tokens per burn initiated   Going even further in to hypothetical proportionality¬†   212.2 factor * $0.00001322 (Current SHIB Price) = $0.00281 per token if the market cap of SHIB gets to the current $1.65 trillion market cap of BTC and that would only require industrial and governmental levels of utilization of the current ecosystem to generate burns over several years.

1jcs0r6,Mr_Lightspeed98,"You‚Äôre conflating the technical mechanism of supply reduction with its economic impact on price.  A ‚Äútrue burn‚Äù‚Äîwhich Shiba Inu does not have and cannot implement without redeploying its original smart contract‚Äîpermanently deletes tokens from the blockchain, explicitly reducing the total supply directly on-chain. In contrast, sending tokens to a dead wallet doesn‚Äôt delete them explicitly; it simply locks them away permanently. Although this doesn‚Äôt technically change the total on-chain supply number, it effectively achieves the same economic result: these tokens are permanently removed from active circulation.  The primary advantage of a true burn is both technical and psychological‚Äîit transparently confirms supply reduction directly on-chain, which can boost investor confidence and market sentiment. However, economically speaking, both burning methods are functionally identical: tokens are permanently unavailable for trading regardless of how they‚Äôre removed.  **HERE IS THE IMPORTANT PART**  Here‚Äôs the critical nuance: neither burning method automatically impacts token price unless the action directly affects the liquidity pools or market demand. Crypto token prices on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap are determined exclusively by the tokens actively available within liquidity pools. Specifically, price is determined by the ratio of tokens to their paired asset (e.g., SHIB to ETH) in these pools.  Burning tokens that aren‚Äôt actively trading‚Äîtokens outside of liquidity pools‚Äîdoes not alter this ratio, and thus won‚Äôt immediately or automatically change the token‚Äôs price. While token burns can influence investor psychology and potentially drive long-term demand indirectly, the immediate market price calculation depends exclusively on active liquidity, not merely total on-chain supply.  Therefore, tokens held outside liquidity pools, whether burned via a true burn or sent to a dead wallet, are economically irrelevant to the immediate pricing mechanism.  To learn more, research the math behind automated market makers as they are the ground truth for pricing.",1,1742169536.0,2025-03-16 23:58:56
