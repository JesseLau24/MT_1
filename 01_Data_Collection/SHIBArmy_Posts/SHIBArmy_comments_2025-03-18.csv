1jegv6b,LinesideOne,"Open your eyes dude!!!! Nothing in the crypto world makes sense but here are the facts..  1. Shib is a top 20 crypto 2. People want Memes because they go crazy out of nowhere 3. Newbies want cheap crypto.. BTC is so darn expensive. Doge will be above a dollar soon so less people will be buying it. Shib is next in line  4. Shib has only had one bullrun in its life, we have NO idea how it‚Äôs going to act on the next one. 5.

1jegv6b,TheIrrepressible1,"1. Keep mentioning how it‚Äôs Top 20 in crypto when 99% of the cryptos are virtually WORTHLESS and have no usage. Shiba is worthless. Hell, Bitcoin is the official coin of every illegitimate money earning business on the planet. The common human being has no use for Bitcoin.   2. No they don‚Äôt. Not since everyone lost their shirt in 2021.   3. Lmao @ doge going to $1 when it‚Äôs highest point never cracked .75‚Ä¶.Doge was a rugpull of epic proportion as well. It‚Äôs is a USELESS coin that solves nothing financially.   4. Sure we know. It‚Äôs right in the toilet exactly where it went down after the pump and dump in ‚Äò21. It‚Äôs never recovered, nor will it ever.   5. It‚Äôs easily predictable. It has zero usage and most of these worthless coins are artificially pumped and then dumped for major profits to those controlling the majority of the coins. Once the price artificially increases, the coins are sold and the price drops faster than thongs off a stripper on a busy Friday night.",1,1742347013.0,2025-03-19 01:16:53

1jegv6b,TheIrrepressible1,"Whatever you say, scammer. Hopefully, they find a way to put you guys behind the walls in a penitentiary.   Laughable how most ‚Äúwhite paper‚Äù are copy and pastes of one other. The actual owners of these bogus memecoins are buried in anonymity. Billions have been lost to fraud in this industry. And here you are insisting THIS is the coin that‚Äôs going to rise to unseen levels one day.   It‚Äôs literally impossible for Shiba to reach $1. Fat chance it reaches .01.

1jegv6b,LinesideOne,"Scammer‚Ä¶? I‚Äôm a scammer because I‚Äôm investing in something that will increase in value? You‚Äôre such a clown! People like you are hilarious, you‚Äôre the same type of person who screamed from mountaintops when BTC was at a nickel saying it‚Äôs a scam don‚Äôt buy it, then again at 1.00, 100.00, 1000.00 and so on. These cryptos will keep gaining value whether you like it or not, that‚Äôs just the way it is. Doge will do the same, before last bullrun it sat at .002 forever then boom, .74 cents. Crypto will be here for a very long time bud, you screaming calling people scammers isn‚Äôt going to stop anything. The next transfer of wealth from the older generation to the newer generation will be injected into the crypto market. That‚Äôs just the way it is. I‚Äôm not saying crypto is the only thing you should invest in, I believe real estate is the best investment out there. However, crypto being so volatile is a high risk/high reward play, when you watch the market cycles over the course of years you can time it so that you buy when it‚Äôs low and sell when it‚Äôs high. People trade every day in the stock market for profit whether it be buying long, short positions and options. Crypto is the same shit just more volatile. The only way crypto will go away is if Satoshi wakes up and cashes out his millions of BTC and completely destroys the price. That‚Äôs literally what it would take. But good luck to you man in whatever it is that you do or trade or invest in.",2,1742383384.0,2025-03-19 11:23:04

1jedb9r,CAN-SUX-IT,Whales leaving is the best thing ever for Shib! The huge holders are the ones who use algorithmic trading programs that harvest money for themselves but It keeps the price suppressed for the rest of us. Whales using algorithmic trading programs are losing their asses in Shib! The problem is there‚Äôs so much Shib and so little owned. 80% of Shiba Inu has never been bought.  It‚Äôs just sitting there unowned and there‚Äôs so much Shib still waiting it makes it difficult for the automated trading platforms to work. Plus the amount of whales that were manipulating Shib was disrupting others who used algorithmic trading programs. So if we see another zero drop we‚Äôll see the whales coming back. But it‚Äôs good riddance for Shib guppies like me.,5,1742331161.0,2025-03-18 20:52:41
