1jg2ity,Willoni_23,"I was wondering when I'd begin to see these posts. I'd be lying if I said I haven't briefly considered swapping into stable. Actually heavily considered it in January. I guess being in crypto for many years now these cycles don't surprise me. I am however certain that this one's different & matter how good at techs it's still completely unpredictable. Shib has made me a lot of money, it's low cost enough to mess with and if you don't need it just keep an eye on it. The difference in % where BTC is vs a lot of alts is not locked in correlation which makes you wonder if BTC backs down into the 70s where the hell are alta going?🤔 A lot are at lows so does that mean alt season begins or do they follow BTC and drop lower than pre cycle? I will say this is how I figured it would go hype fades coins die but doge lasts & imo shib will last. It's too big and there's a lot at work. Get yourselves to a point in price where you have enough that you don't need it to moon for yourself to take big profits. We've already got bags of it. You know it's going to go up and down. If you don't, trust us. It will. Swap to stable on a pump, swap back in a drops and multiply holdings lowering your avg cost and one big pump later cha ching, again!

1jg2ity,blackcell1,"Committe to a burn protocol? They've got one. It's on shibarium,   I'm starting to think all shib holders are stupid, I'm sure 90% of shib holders didn't buy shib in a low market cap so they missed the big gains, bones a low MC so profits to be made.  Shib holders want burns? Shibarium burns shib on every transaction.   Hold shib and bone and be rich? Well when the alt market rocks up.",0,1742553642.0,2025-03-21 10:40:42

1jg2ity,BowDown2No1ButCrypto,"The entire crypto market is down right now! But I'm more confident than ever that it's all gonna change very soon, and we'll see prices of crypto skyrocket. For me personally, it's a long-term play with my crypto investments. There's a lot of things going on right now behind the scenes for crypto, and the catalysts will send the prices through the roof! I've been doing lots of reading/researching on crypto and their charts history, and I'm even more convinced than ever that the payoff that all of us investors seek, is coming in the not so distant future!

1jg2ity,Recent-Ad8165,"This one money making blueprint that's for sure. First off I got a job but I work for peanuts. Can't land anything else coz I'm not qualified. Can't study or learn any skills coz said job takes most of my time. It's literally impossible for me to live off 2 weeks check I can barely survive with full pay check.  2. Need capital to flip  3. Still need capital  4. Tried that when I was younger with my uncle, he died and I don't want to get a criminal record, I got too many dependents.  5. Can't do Nomad coz of said dependents.  6. Joined a cult, it's called church but the tried to take from me instead of giving.  7. Scamming sounds worse than robbing people. It also requires a bit of time, cpu and ram (I don't even remember what I ate for lunch today) which I don't have.  8. Money could and would never become a useless token to me. Too many dependents that I wish to keep alive. I would literally become a hitman (I need connections for that, I tried to find clients already) for them.",2,1742920281.0,2025-03-25 16:31:21
