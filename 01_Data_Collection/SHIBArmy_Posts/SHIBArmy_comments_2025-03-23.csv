1jhrgj9,TranquilOminousBlunt,"Itâ€™s a lot better to make your self forget that you have it .Yea I know, forgetting something like this? wtf how!? .   Ive  accomplished it once, and now Iâ€™m here again trying to make myself forget. Itâ€™s hard but just quit checking prices, quit checking the account.

1jhrgj9,Yinzer_Yoda,"Took the time to strengthen my position this week. Swallowed the small loss for the greater gain I'll see with having my stockpile at a cheaper buy in now. Risky move, but going to be worth it. #ShibArmy",2,1742770582.0,2025-03-23 22:56:22

1jhrgj9,FuroreLT,"All you clowns think about are these meme coins, you drive yourselves crazy. Just buy yourself a good amount of it and just wait.

1jhrgj9,Snoo_74135,"I hope my 15 million Shiba Inu are enough for wonderful things.  Frankly, I got in years ago and last year, traded out into crow with knife, took a decent profit, then folded that into the loaded lion token and made out all right there as well. Not holding the majority of my Shiba Inu tokens has made more money than simply holding. Best of luck to everyone .",0,1742793243.0,2025-03-24 05:14:03
