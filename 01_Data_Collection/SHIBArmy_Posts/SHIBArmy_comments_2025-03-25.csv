1jj6p6b,NihilistHUGZ,"I posted this one a while back but the logic is the same concept and I dont want to redo this math so here it is 'copy/paste'  ""I got one for you! I know you've all heard the, ""What if Shiba Inu was the price of Bitcoin""... no one ever factored in the burns did they?? If you take as a hypothetical future base valuation for SHIB and the ecosystem the current valuation of BTC the burns could be extremely impactful to cost and scarcity. Think about this:   If SHIB has a market cap of $7.77 billion and 123330500 tokens are burned upon each 100 BONE it works out like this   12330500 / $7770000000 = 0.001586 tokens burned roughly per day per $ of market cap   Now lets factor that down with BTC by market caps   1.65 / 7.77 = 0.2122 proportionally  0.2122 * 1000 = 212.2 factor rate  212.2 * 12330500 = 2616532100 future tokens per burn initiated   Going even further in to hypothetical proportionality¬†   212.2 factor * $0.00001322 (Current SHIB Price) = $0.00281 per token if the market cap of SHIB gets to the current $1.65 trillion market cap of BTC and that would only require industrial and governmental levels of utilization of the current ecosystem to generate burns over several years.   I didn‚Äôt factor in the scarcity factoring to the increase of price AND I also didn‚Äôt add in the intrinsic value the utilizations would be valued at adding even more to the potential price. That‚Äôs just business as usual and remember SENTIMENT IS KING‚Ä¶.AND‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt add that either. Objectively in the years ahead SHIB priced at $0.00281 a token is extremely realistic!""   This shows that as the market cap increases while coupled with burns from ecosystem utilization the whole thing is more than achievable.

1jj6p6b,IGotMetalingus1,Supply makes it out of range.

1jj6p6b,MaxIsSaltyyyy,"Realistically Shib could hit .001 but that would take a 500 billion dollar market cap. Will it ever hit that? I highly doubt it as I believe Shib is slowing on support now that people are realizing burns aren‚Äôt going to pump the coin. It‚Äôs one of the largest meme coins, but it still can‚Äôt compete with coins like Doge and even that is no where close to a 100 billion market cap. I personally plan to sell my Shib if it goes over .00006 or higher to all time highs again as I know that is likely to happen. TBH with you I have a feeling if Shib has one more big run it could be its last. It doesn‚Äôt have the same hype, support, and following that Doge has and the devs have been getting less and less active. Gotta remember the whales that pump Shib are in it to make money and they won‚Äôt bag hold. So if Shib hits all time highs again those whales will start dumping Shib and if and when that happens everyone else will start dumping. with slowing support Shib might not recover again. That‚Äôs just my assumptions on Shibs life span though.",3,1742907744.0,2025-03-25 13:02:24
