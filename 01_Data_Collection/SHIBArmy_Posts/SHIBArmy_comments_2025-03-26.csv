1jkaor2,CitizenCraigXD,"​As of March 29, 2025, **Shiba Inu (SHIB)** has a market capitalization of approximately **$7.54 billion USD**. A 1% increase in market cap equates to about **$75.4 million USD**.​[Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/price/shiba-inu?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  However, the actual amount of capital required to achieve this 1% price increase depends on several factors:​  * **Liquidity:** Higher liquidity means the market can absorb larger trades without significant price changes.​ * **Order Book Depth:** A deeper order book with substantial buy and sell orders can mitigate price volatility from large trades.​ * **Market Sentiment:** Positive news or trends can amplify price movements, while negative sentiment can dampen them.​  Given SHIB's substantial market cap and trading volume, a direct infusion of $75.4 million USD might not precisely result in a 1% price increase due to these dynamics. The interplay of liquidity, order book depth, and market sentiment means that the actual impact of such an investment can vary. It's also important to note that the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and price movements can be influenced by factors beyond capital inflows.",1,1743262087.0,2025-03-29 15:28:07
