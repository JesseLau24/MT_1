1jlemhs,Plastic-List215,Come on guys just be thankful some people are making the effort. How many shib have you burnt. Sit down,13,1743127653.0,2025-03-28 02:07:33
1jlemhs,jbraden,"If what I read in a different article is true, the wallet held 3B Shib. That's not a whale.  We also don't know if it's a project wallet.  While we're grateful for the burns, we should keep our excitement realistic. 1B is a lot to most individuals, but it's not much to the 589T in supply. The click bait using the burn percentage increase is so tiring. When you burn nothing for a day and then 1B is burnt the next, of course the percent skyrockets.   I just wish these people would stop writing burn updates this way. It's very easy to say ""1B Shib has been burned"" without throwing in a BS rate percentage.",19,1743112955.0,2025-03-27 22:02:35

1jlemhs,Merlin1039,Not only that but if it actually had value it wouldn't get burned by someone hoping it went up in value. It could literally burn 2 billion a day and never have an impact,-1,1743126277.0,2025-03-28 01:44:37

1jlca5u,PatientBaker7172,"If you look at the sell dates, people are selling Shiba to pay for their student loans in the past couple of months because it quadrapled.   By the end of the off-ramp period, the New York Fed estimates that the volume of past-due federal student loans hit 15.6%, with over $250 billion in delinquent debt.  ‚ÄúAccording to these numbers, it is reasonable to expect student loan delinquency to surpass pre-pandemic levels when new delinquencies hit credit reports,‚Äù the Fed‚Äôs report says.  A new student loan delinquency can cause a borrower‚Äôs credit score to drop more than 150 points, the Fed warns.",1,1743139920.0,2025-03-28 05:32:00
1jlca5u,NihilistHUGZ,"Its good that you are thinking outside of the box. The issue however is that your conclusion lacks weight. If this were the case then more sectors would have reflected this same influence. There have been dozens of consequential economic reports, white house updates to tariffs, a handful of serious regional disputes around the globe, and global natural disasters which play a more impactful role in catalyzing market movements. The full range of micro/macroeconomics, socioeconomics, geopolitics, and good old general sentiment are all the cause for what we are experiencing. If student loans were the issue it would be THE ISSUE and tariffs are talked about more than the studen loans situation. Not to down play it because student loans but there is a much bigger picture to zoom out on!",1,1743181123.0,2025-03-28 16:58:43
