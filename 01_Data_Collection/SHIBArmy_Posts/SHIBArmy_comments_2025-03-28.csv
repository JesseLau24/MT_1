1jm3ho4,N/A,Shib prediction. In 2025.    I m seeing shib since 2021...   My analysis says 0.001 shib reaches easily and minimum 0.00045 . ,4,1743239231.0,2025-03-29 09:07:11
1jm3ho4,Yinzer_Yoda,"$Shib spring break sale is on and on point. Get in while the prices are this low. Next jump the doggo makes is coming soon. End of April, early May. But that's only the first jump. Think there's be an even bigger leap after a short correction from the first. And as they say, the third move in a W pattern is almost always bigger then the 1st. Let's just hope the politics of the day doesn't cause too much pain to foil it from happening.",5,1743191326.0,2025-03-28 19:48:46

1jm3ho4,LittyMctiddie,"Big yikes. I see we are at the delusional point of the market cycle where you hold onto a pipe dream while watching your accounts drop another 50%. No one wanted to believe we had a cycle top at .000044. Yet here we are and probably going even lower, gaining another zero likely, to 0.0000055   P.s: this is where we should be buying folks",1,1743700072.0,2025-04-03 17:07:52

1jm3ho4,Extension-Ad4554,DCA. I’m a long term holder not someone farming for likes/karma. I also don’t provide financial advice and act as if others should listen or that I’m “smarter” than others. There’s risks in every investment unless it’s Berkshire Hathaway. But I appreciate your comment and point of view.,1,1743700261.0,2025-04-03 17:11:01

1jlz3k1,_blockchainlife,"Yeah the “community” doesn’t have even a fraction of that. That’s all whales. People on this sub talk about 1 billion shib as being meaningful. On a scale of 500+ trillion, a billion is like a grain of sand on the beaches that border the pacific ocean.
