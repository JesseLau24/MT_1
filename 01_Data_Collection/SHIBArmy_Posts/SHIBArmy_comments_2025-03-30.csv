1jn1h83,Snoo_74135,"Holy smokes, I bought into Shiba Inu big-time in late 2021 and rode it down to almost 90% losses. I would watch YouTube videos about updates and how things were going to improve, I made posts to try to support the community, and then all the development team did was build tokens to support themselves, bone and leash and bullshit! I just wanted Shiba Inu to rise the way they said it would. At some point, I swapped 95% out of Shiba Inu into other projects and I‚Äôve recovered almost 50% of my losses, if I‚Äôd stayed in, it wouldn‚Äôt have improved much at all. I cut my losses with this project, keeping a small bag as a souvenir of pain. Best of luck to all of you that think this token can do something. Look at the charts that spike in the first year of a project and fizzle out to nothing. This is Shiba Inu chart. Sorry to point this out if it upsets you.",8,1743298623.0,2025-03-30 01:37:03

1jn1h83,Public_Chemical5038,"It was not just the burn but the burn helped , the main thing was Elon Musk tweeting I'm getting a Shiba inu hence why Doge and Shib pumped. Then the burn just added to the sudden surge of adoption. Look at the way prices move with Elon tweets most recently was that squirrel peanut that made many people a lot of money. Shibarium needs liquidity so it might do some good but not much for Shib. The primary reason for price movement would be adoption. If Elon tweets something about Shiba inu during the bullrun this could go 100s billions, hypothetically speaking of course.",1,1743325978.0,2025-03-30 09:12:58

1jn1h83,IGotMetalingus1,I've been in since 2021 when I was told it was going to be the doge killer. Did what I was told and forgot I had it until the last bull run around October and learnt more about supply and MC and when I seen the other coins with a lot more potential I realized I was wasting my time with shib. These other coins with much smaller supply had a team actually trying to make their project important and relevant. After that I transferred all my shib to these other projects and immediately my portfolio was consistently green and actually had movement.
