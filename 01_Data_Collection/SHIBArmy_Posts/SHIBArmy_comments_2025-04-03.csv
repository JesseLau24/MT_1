1jqimt8,NihilistHUGZ,"Thank you for your podcast, and I enjoyed listening to your series with regards to direct democracy and blockchain utilization. In my personal life, I've kept involvement with the government in my direct life, and it has always been my opinion that there does need to be some form of modernization to the representative democratic process, if not a hybridization towards direct democracy. However, you touch on a fundamental main issue in your podcast with security, but outside of that, the fluidity of a liquid democracy seems to deviate from the idea of direct democracy.  With the complexity of the human component, the idea of implementing blockchain for direct democracy poses the threat of creating borders, like following the world war eras. The issue was that people were not static, like the borders were drawn, and it created internal issues following because it divided tribal lands and all sorts of things; we pose the same issue, but in a technological way, by making this democracy become a liquid state. The influence, where elected officials face constant threat of being removed based on their short term public dissatisfaction, will only result in a dynamic system that can only alleviate segments of a problem, while alienating the long term policy initiative.  This would undermine the stability of our institutions, as it would allow inherent inequality to stem from the levels of digital literacy and internet access, as you had touched on as well. In a way, the blockchain technology would further disenfranchise different vulnerable populations and discourage long term growth by creating a burden of short term volatility. In the same way that I find in my analysis that 'Sentiment is King', we can apply that same concept to the archetypal arrangements of human psychology, and if you take that and further refine it to a country like the United States and try to apply a liquid democracy, it would ultimately unbalance the power of the people and then further create a global instability. If all nations use a liquid democratic system, then how effective are the institutions for the localized individual, who becomes swept up in the wave of sentiment and forgotten, like the borders of the world war eras?",1,1743694629.0,2025-04-03 15:37:09
1jqimt8,Blotsy,"Thank you for listening. You have a lot of very poignant thoughts and points.   I believe your concerns to be valid. I argue that the problems you point out, can be solved within the confines of the same system.   Some things should be changeable, some things need to be adapted faster. Long term stability is very important for societal function. The democratic process could elect to set certain legislation in a firmer way. Requiring a super-majority of 70% of the vote to alter (or whatever number we, as a collective, deem appropriate).  A hybrid model would be more appropriate initially. We start a grassroot organization. We put the system in place. Then we gain enough voter traction to become a powerful voting block in our traditional elections. The politicians need to pay attention to what we are voting for. What we want. If they don't, we remove them from office in the next election cycle.   You speak very eloquently to the issue of managing a large country with this process. I think you're correct! This system would by it's nature, focus power to the local level. There may be some federal details that still require a national vote. Ideally people would feel empowered to make their local communities (country level) more powerful and easily accessible.   There's a big sentiment in the United States, that something has got to change. If we can rally people behind a system of governance (rather than political parties), I think we could find a lot of traction across the aisle.   Again, thank you for taking the time to listen and respond. I really appreciate it.",1,1743703818.0,2025-04-03 18:10:18
1jqimt8,NihilistHUGZ,"I really appreciate your perspective and have given this a lot of thought. I support using blockchain to reform our democracy, but I worry that the current proposal may end up creating a system that functions more like liquid democracy. In such a setup, votes can shift quickly, much like high frequency trading bots in investing that create rapid, unpredictable swings that most people cannot keep up with.  My concern extends to the idea that change can happen instantly. Our culture often expects immediate results, but important decisions need time to settle. Rome was not built in a day, and a voting system that reacts to every fleeting moment might only lead to short term fixes instead of thoughtful, lasting policies.  I am reminded of 'Fahrenheit 451' , where society becomes so absorbed in surface distractions that there is little room left for deep thinking. If our voting process mirrors this by reacting too quickly to shifting sentiments, we risk reducing our political system to constant reaction rather than steady progress.  I remain a strong believer in the benefits of blockchain and have long supported its use in various industries, as seen by my own petition for its broader adoption. I also know that SHIB is being integrated in the UAE. Reports indicate that the UAE is working with SHIB to bring Web3 solutions into their government services. Their Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure is partnering with Shiba Inu to improve operations and enhance public service, demonstrating that a measured approach to blockchain can yield real benefits in practice.  How might you suggest we create a governance framework that uses blockchain to keep things transparent and accountable while still allowing a pace that gives room for thoughtful reflection and long term stability?",1,1743712247.0,2025-04-03 20:30:47
1jqimt8,Blotsy,"This is such a wonderful question.   Complete transparency will be necessary for the system to function. Pair this with the need for complete anonymity, and you have a wonderfully complex problem.   Each person has one vote. This vote can be delegated to another. I can always see what my vote was used for. This keeps politicians honest. It is transparent to the constituents what their politicians voted for. The individual vote of a private person is just a token. The token can be anonymized through technology similar to ""cash tornado"" and the likes. I can always track my own token though. I have a record of who used my token, and for what.   With a modular voting system, anything can be baked into legislation.   Let's imagine a piece of legislation as a Reddit post.   ""Fix the potholes on Main St.""  The bill proposes that $X money be assigned to fix the potholes. That Contractor Inc. will be signed to fix it.  In the comments, people in the community believe it should be put up for a bid. The ""bidding"" comment achieves enough traction (and votes) to amend the original text. The potholes on Main St will be fixed, and any licensed contractor may bid on the job.   Once the bill has enough votes to pass, it will be locked for a week (or whatever amount of time is appropriate). This allows individuals who voted by proxy to retract their votes. It also prevents the politicians from switching their vote last minute, to change the outcome. The grace period is for proxy voters only.   To further speak to legislation that needs to ""settle"". If we pass a law that is for a long term benefit, it can have its rules baked into the text.   For example, this law can only be amended after four years, by majority vote. If a change achieves 69% of the majority, the four year rule can be overturned.   This question often goes hand in hand with executive power. What if we need someone to make an unpopular decision? It'll never be voted through the democratic process, but we must evacuate due to a hurricane warning. We don't have time to set the evacuation order to a vote. We need someone to make the call. Who makes this call?   I hand my vote to a famed and accurate meteorologist, this individual handles my vote in all hurricane emergency matters. They band together with their colleagues. Together they have the mandate to invoke an evacuation order. No need to heed a governor.   Here's where it becomes interesting. Mr. Business holds my vote on all matters of the economy. Mr. Meteorologist has my vote in a hurricane emergency. Business says that we can't shut down, the meteorologist says we have to evacuate. I get pinged to make a choice. My vote is about to be used in two different directions.   I have sent my vote off to work in my best interest, in an automated and transparent way. It asks me the question, what do I want?  Should the individual voter have such power? I would argue, yes. The individual person might not make the right choice, in a given situation. The democratic rule of the many, will average out to the correct answer.   This is a wonderful conversation. Thank you for engaging.",1,1743769831.0,2025-04-04 12:30:31
1jqimt8,NihilistHUGZ,"I really appreciate your creative approach to integrating blockchain into the democratic process. Your plan has many interesting ideas and it is clear you put considerable thought into issues such as transparency, anonymity, and expert intervention when needed. From my experience as an active participant in state government submissions and from firsthand insight through my father, who is a mayor, I worry that your system is missing a few important aspects.  I know how difficult it is to get genuine public participation. Even when channels exist for input, very few people engage, and even the ones who do often do not receive the attention they deserve. Moreover, working at the local level, I have seen just how challenging it is to balance budgets while reconciling the diverse needs of community members. I am not trying to shut down your idea at all. Instead, I think it needs a more fixed and managed framework.  I am thinking back to the legislative acts that were established after 9/11 and how they created our Real STAR ID. This existing system could be incorporated into a blockchain platform that uses government issued identification to address the digital divide. Registration could also be available at local government offices or community centers. This would enable someone who does not have access to personal devices or technology to sign up and take part in the process. The system would use our Real STAR ID to issue a unique digital token that represents our individual vote. Blockchain methods would secure that token so that it remains anonymous while still being fully verifiable. This would provide a layer of security and inclusion that keeps the system open to public audit.  Next, citizens would have to give their vote either directly or delegate it to someone they trust on a particular issue. The delegation option helps those who are busy or less confident in their expertise to assign their vote to a local expert or a trusted politician for that specific subject. Voters would be able to track how their token is used and could retract that delegation during a set window as you discussed. This feature would keep representatives accountable while ensuring that individual voters retain ultimate control over their vote.  With this in mind, I propose a multi stage voting system that includes a preliminary vote stage, as you suggested, with defined thresholds. For minor decisions, there could be a window of 48 hours to one week for reflection. For larger issues that could have a long term impact on policy, these would require a supermajority level of 70 percent before being enforced to protect against impulsive changes.  I already use systems that exist to participate in Senate level discussions and believe these should be incorporated into blockchain utilization. Every piece of legislation would be treated like a living document, with proposals publicly visible and recorded on the blockchain. Amendments could then be introduced and community members could comment on changes, offering a window for thorough deliberation and consensus.  You also touch on an important point regarding delegation in crisis situations. For example, in natural disaster scenarios, votes could be pre pooled, which would allow for swift action. Once the emergency passes, a post event review could occur using the living documentation method. The broader population could then reexamine and adjust those decisions, further balancing rapid responses without compromising accountability in the long run.  Given my experience with state submissions and the challenges I have observed in local government, I would suggest piloting any system on a small scale, such as in local municipalities. These would serve as test beds where the blockchain based system works in tandem with traditional public input channels. Real world participation in local government would ease the transition and provide us with valuable feedback.  This approach also serves as a major component to educate citizens on how to use a digital token based on their Real STAR ID while still allowing traditional voting methods. Clear communication about how each stage of the system functions and the timing involved would help citizens understand that they can be more involved without being overwhelmed. Continuous feedback and regular reviews would adapt the system to become more user friendly, secure, and effective.  I believe that by keeping the core of your idea and addressing some of the issues I have observed firsthand, we have formed the basis for a proper framework. I am really excited for your input and to see how we might be able to blend our ideas further.",1,1743779843.0,2025-04-04 15:17:23
1jqimt8,Blotsy,"I think we are mostly in agreement! We are having the same thoughts. You put it very eloquently.   Two issues I address in my podcast. First, engagement. People feel disenfranchised. Most Americans I encounter feel like their vote doesn't matter. The system still solves this problem, by it's inherent nature.  Second, there are requirements for the system to exist. The final stages of a direct democracy require that each citizen has Internet access and a device.   I consider Internet access, a human right.   The FFC already laid the groundwork with the abolishment of net neutrality. Access can now be provided by the service being accessed. Google should pay for my access to their search engine. The people are their product after all.   The government should pay for access to democracy.  The initial stages are going to be far more grassroots oriented, as you say.   It's been an absolute pleasure speaking with you. Yes, this is an idea that has sat with me since the inception of the blockchain.",1,1743827292.0,2025-04-05 04:28:12
1jqimt8,NihilistHUGZ,"This has been a pleasurable conversation, and given the history of this subreddit please trust that I have valued your iron sharpening mine. It is rare but welcome. I have a general principle that I follow using ""5 whys"" to get to the root of the problem, and your comment is the fifth since the podcast. If we follow this same principle, then we have seemingly come to the root of the issue. The root of the issue is value, the value of opinion, the intrinsic value of service, the value of democracy, the value of rights. It is at the root, value, that purpose meets substance. Without the value of privacy, would the FCC have abolished net neutrality? I do not see the value of that abolition without the value of substance and so on for a world lacking that substance. Intrinsically, value is the substance.  What in your life is free other than the air you breathe? No work can add to or truly take away from the true substance of that which fills our lungs, just as water or food is essential substance. Yet these require work, which can add to or take away from the substance, thereby creating value. The system of value needs to change before the substance can change. Although we have the infrastructure to achieve the substance, the work makes value a hurdle.  If we take any system, specifically direct democracy using blockchain technology, there would need to be individuals who invest time and effort to make that system function and exist. They then create value. We must address that. We cannot start there. What comes next is to look at the right of access itself before implementation. We must legislate and participate within an existing system to achieve that end, and again we create value through effort. Every aspect that we trace down is tied to a value component, and there is no overcoming that.  To begin, there need to be smaller systems that can grow into a larger network. In towns and at the county level the initiative should start with creating a right to internet as a basic infrastructure feature, like plumbing or electricity, and not merely as a secondary service. That would have to be established over a span of time to allow for redundancies and erosions as part of a test for a larger network of connectivity. Then at the state level those systems could further consolidate communications, resource allocation, and emergency management, for example.  An infrastructure needs to grow from within the system of value before the substance can overcome the value component. There is no avoiding that; it is a fact dictated by thousands of years of human development, not by me. Start with access and provision at the most local level, and everything from there will be achievable. At the smallest levels the greatest change is feasible. The implementation of blockchain in democracy in an expedited form would look like jumping off a cliff and barely being able to see the safety net. It is the sense of safety, the value of safety, and realistically it is just the human condition.  I again concede in the pleasure of this conversation and only hope that I have been able to add a touch of insight to help sharpen you as well.",1,1743868252.0,2025-04-05 15:50:52
1jqimt8,Blotsy,"I think a few of your points in your last comment were lost on me. In regards to substance and value.   I do think that the problem is a chicken and egg situation. These systems need to proliferate from the other. A change to our Fiat financial system needs to come from governance. To change our system of government, we need to make large changes to our financial system (value system?).   The options are: Enact small changes on a local level, or brute force either system (jumping off a cliff).   I believe a brute force alternative might be the correct answer here. When I say brute force, I do NOT mean violence.   Brute force means large societal pressure. This pressure exists already, it is a large generalized pressure without any specific direction. To speak in metaphor, the pressure of the ocean is large and evenly distributed across the ocean floor. This is the generalized dissent. If we gave the pressure an outlet. A directed pipe, draining from the ocean floor. That pressure can be directed and given motion. The pipe is the system of a direct democracy. The direction the pipe is pointing, is dictated by democratic means. We just need to access to the pressure. Give the people a means to exert their influence/pressure. Other than at the voting booth (mostly meaningless) or in the streets as protest (large amount of effort, and mostly ineffective).",1,1743870771.0,2025-04-05 16:32:51
1jqimt8,NihilistHUGZ,"This line of conversation led me to studies and searching for how to connect with you in a way that would benefit your endeavor. It was, in a way, laid on my heart. Our conversation about heterodox economics sparked a renewed interest for me, and the concept of ""value"" is where I really dug in. I think there is a way to move forward, but your organization needs to enter the sphere of conversation with specialists such as Trevor Jackson or David McNally. The structures you discuss are anti-Marxist in nature, and I heard a quote that may resonate with you: ""Capitalism is not broken and in need of being fixed. On the contrary, it is working correctly, and in need of being overthrown.""  In all honesty, I want to say that the scope of the project you are proposing lacks ""six sigma"" for me, and I believe it needs greater structure. I mean no disrespect, rather, I fully support you. It is out of this support that I implore you to read 'The Fall and Rise of American Capitalism' by Stephen Maher and Scott Aquanno. This book provides foundational insights into what I refer to as ""substance"" and ""value,"" addressing the very core of capitalism and its historical creation.  I took my time to respond because I wanted it to carry the utmost value for such an engaging and meaningful conversation. Once again, thank you for this conversation.",1,1744477206.0,2025-04-12 17:00:06
1jqimt8,Blotsy,"Communism is an ideal set for a distant future. Capitalism is for the present moment, without regard for the future.   Communism has failed repeatedly, due to the technology not being there. I mean, for an equal distribution of wealth to function, we need an unbiased system. This system must not be influenced by human hands. So far, we have been unable to implement it. This is changing.  Capitalism as a concept is stunning and powerful. A free market, determining the value of goods and services. We place a value on these goods and services. This value is measured in money.   We have moved away from capitalism. We are in a post-capitalist world. Money can now be bought. The value indicator is now purchasable. This is fundamentally flawed.   We need a value system. We need to be able to determine that the service of a surgeon is of a higher value than the service of a man digging a hole.   These values need to be able to fluctuate in response to the needs of society. If a great flood is looming, the hole-digging service is suddenly in very high demand. Digging ditches and barricades. Maybe the value becomes so high, that the surgeon is encouraged to go digging with the rest of society.   We need a measure of value. This measure is just that, a measuring device. It should never be purchasable goods.  We need to shrug off a lot of the old concepts of capitalism and communism. These ideas were forged in an old society. We should still learn from history. We need to found our new philosophy on the shoulders of history. Redefining these ideas for a modern time is necessary. Being clear in our definitions is the key to creating a shared vocabulary to discuss our next steps.  Thanks for continuing to engage.",1,1744478191.0,2025-04-12 17:16:31
