1jr00qd,FinishZealousideal63,Yes. I call them every time and waste as much of their time as I possibly can. It ends with them trying to get you to transfer your funds to a wallet address that they provide 10 of the 12 words of the seed phrase in a text message and then they tell you the last 2 over the phone.
