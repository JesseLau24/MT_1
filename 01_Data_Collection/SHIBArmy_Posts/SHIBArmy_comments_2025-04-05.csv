1jsd6ws,Beautiful_Deer_2757,"Depends on the situation. If iv sold then it pumps sometimes, at the time its a situation where if i buy back in I could be top blasting. So if im not watching it and waiting for a dip, il just leave it but obviously in hindsight it seems stupid. This isn‚Äôt even my most painful reflection. Buying about 8,200,000 WIF for 3 SOL within the first few hours is the biggest one. I did constantly  it and sell on the way up, but after it passed 10 mill MC, again I felt like I could be top blasting. Oh how I was wrong. But back then I‚Äôd be in about 10-15 different plays in Sol, a few in ETH, as well as being active on several other chains to farm yields or airdrops. Now I‚Äôm still on several chains a day and finding new alphas to get in early on for good airdrop allocations, but not in the trenches so hard. Il jump into plays that iv watched for a couple of days so i know if its a quick rotate or a long hold to scale out of eventually.

I am holding along with a large group of people onto Kendu for a long time at this point. No one truly knows if that will be a good choice or not, but I do believe.  I also just realized how price is correlated with WIF...wow  My rule is to make sure I take out initials always from now on at least and have a clear rule for long term or just for profit (I still believe in Kendu, so that is fine, but not taking a 15x on MEGA was so stupid of me). I don't chase plays though really tried it on SOL and just can't watch all day or quasi constantly, so that isn't the strategy for me.",1,1744754369.0,2025-04-15 21:59:29

Too much of the shit in circulation for it to make anything big of itself at this point. If ever.   And unless a gigantic burn happens like it did once in the past.  Who knows.
