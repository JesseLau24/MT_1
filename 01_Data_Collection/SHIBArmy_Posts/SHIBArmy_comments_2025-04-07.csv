1jtnsmz,Timanious,Never noticed:) But there is always a basset hound in all of Mamoru oshii‚Äôs movies. He said something about that they evolved to have such a sad expression because it‚Äôs matches the human emotion or something philosophical like that:) I‚Äôm not sure but I think he mentioned it in an interview about Avalon. Still one of my favorite movies ever.,3,1744152462.0,2025-04-08 22:47:42
