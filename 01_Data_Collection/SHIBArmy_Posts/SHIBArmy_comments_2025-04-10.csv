1jvksaj,No_Pick5430,"Agreed...but I thought critically of what a 401k is. How at phased intervals everyone pools thier funds and over time, you get a pension. Well, what if you invest on your own and play the crypto market? Now I'm not saying to do it this way...but add this strategy. SHIB then has millions of potential bag holders that collectively is the DOG POUND. We all hold a large portion. But based on volatility, you still need to use the other wallet to gain more SHIB. We hodlers are the owners of the dog pound. When businesses find the value of this, then things will get interesting for all of us.",1,1744472695.0,2025-04-12 15:44:55
1jvksaj,No_Pick5430,That means the Whales are the defacto power brokers and banks can strike deals on the massive SHIB holdings. We could effectively lend the SHIB out since it's cheaper to lend than other currencies.,1,1744472986.0,2025-04-12 15:49:46

1jvksaj,Sudden-Baker-9943,What price did you get in at? I think it went down to .0000105?? Itâ€™s back up rn I think because the tariffs were put on hold but imo itâ€™ll prob go lower again. I have a limit buy set at .000010 and I might just cancel that to go lower,0,1744249153.0,2025-04-10 01:39:13

1jvksaj,No_Pick5430,As I was explaining it to someone in a dm: You have one wallet. Got in at .000008. Never selling that one. Then I have this account I mess around with. Talked to the bot and we are looking to flip 3 to 5 percent every cycle. The bot told me how many times it would take to compound the interest to match  what I got in the first wallet. I have to wait for the downturn to buy and the wait to sell at 3 percent. The fact that people panic and sell thier stuff so fast made me realize I can make a quick buck. What it also does is allow me to build the SHIB over time since that's all I seem to have nowadays...is time.,0,1744314041.0,2025-04-10 19:40:41
