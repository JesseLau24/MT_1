1jyg657,NihilistHUGZ,"If you only knew the true value in the 'nothing'. I can use a piece of that analysis and combine it with candlestick and chart patterns with some Fibonacci retracements and short, mid, or long sell THE WORLD at greater than 75% win rate. You need to rethink your position if you read 'nothing' because that is a large part of a broader system that veteran investors use and I have been teaching it for almost a year everyday to help SHIB have the most knowledgeable investors. You read the FUD/FOMO cure and got nothing! Good luck in your life.",0,1744640301.0,2025-04-14 14:18:21
1jyg657,billybonestorm,"Sorry, i thought you were joking for a second. So you have been doing detailed analysis for a whole year!?  and I will assume from your language that your analysis led you to buy/hold? I won't check, but I doubt you ever posted on here encouraging a sell-off.    How has that worked out for you over 12 months? Looks like you are down 60%.    That begs the question, if a 60% loss is the outcome, what is the value in the analysis?    Being a bag-holder is one thing, but you're asking for extra homework as well.",1,1744645671.0,2025-04-14 15:47:51

1jy7cun,Honest_Economist_283,I think shib is dead. Too much competition out there not enough volume. 600k members and only 35 of us on here. That should tell you that this train is going no where anytime soon. I bought in 2021 for super low and it's close to where I bought.,6,1744568899.0,2025-04-13 18:28:19

1jy7cun,JupiterChime,"There are over 2million people that have Shib wallets  At that rate, if 2mil ppl bought, there could only be an average of 250milliona held in each wallet before running out   Reddit only represents a fraction of holders, it doesn‚Äôt show everyone!

1jy7cun,IGotMetalingus1,"You're not wrong, there's no volume left in shib to give any significant gains. I'd say it's the worst investment at the moment, huge supply, low volume and a team that don't know how to help the situation. The volume is drastically dropping by the year. Even if it hits the ath it still has a lot of work to call itself a success and I doubt it will survive the chances of a correction period. Too much work when you can go to a smaller supply coin and hit the goals you had with shib in half the time",2,1744602051.0,2025-04-14 03:40:51
