1k2egfo,nycstockup,What is good entry price that has support I wanna buy,1,1745084445.0,2025-04-19 17:40:45
1k2egfo,NihilistHUGZ,Right now we have long-term and short-term neutral major pivot Points converging meaning that the support and resistance walls are well defined showing a bottom. If you're looking for a good buy in then I would take whatever your current Target entry price is and then look at the average true range for a long-term time frame which sets price movements at a typical current level of $0.00000096. So if we take today's average neutral level based on my algorithm we get $0.00001204. So a move below that that would be to $0.00001108 for lowest possible entry target and a move above would be $0.00001300. When I do my day trading I use ATR movements for quick insight and that would mean using my method your entry range to choose a buy postion rests within $0.00001108 to $0.00001300. Of you buy nearer to the top then you bought the short term top of the long term bottom. If you buy nearer to $0.00001108 then you are buying the short term bottom of the long term bottom. I can explain this out however you need so if this is a little confusing just let me know,1,1745095433.0,2025-04-19 20:43:53
1k2egfo,NihilistHUGZ,Also part of my trading strategy that I have put together over a few years is to incorporate into your entry strategy a straddle. Take whatever Capital you intend to invest and only inject 50% at any point within that range I gave you. Then follow it and DCA 30% when you see a strong dip and the remaining 20% keep DCA through every dip you see on down days until you're able to inject 100% of the capital into that investment. This will allow you to play a longer entry strategy and capture lower averages rather than taking the entire lump and throwing it in.,1,1745095639.0,2025-04-19 20:47:19
