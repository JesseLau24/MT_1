Built it up to 1.25B  I see it more of a long term hold now, whereas when I first got into it I saw it as a gamble with some hopium mixed in.  Stick it out, donâ€™t dump it if youâ€™re down a lot.

1k89xvb,Additional_Mark_852,"honestly your hopium is that shib is well placed market cap wise to have big gains the next time the market in general is bullish. crypto will pump again, at least BTC during the next halving. we're not done with greed yet. shib and doge will always pump a little separate from other alts too. honestly unless theres a huge change btc doge and shib are like the only coins that matter because its all sentiment. believing in them purely on sentiment is the clearest vision",9,1745682925.0,2025-04-26 15:55:25

1k89xvb,NihilistHUGZ,Do any of you know Wyckoff Theory or Fibonacci Retracements...?  Smart Money whales have SHIB as a part of their managed portfolio and the reason that we see such stability is because serious analysts and skilled traders hold more SHIB than easily spooked looking for fast money retail investors.  Thats why as the price appreciation moves through the sell wall retail investors jump because they have been scared waiting to get out and break even.  Smart Money has nearly shaken out all the weak longs from small holders by letting their DCAs act as exit liquidity.  Algorithms from managed portfolios provide volatility and liquidity and what is happening right now??,8,1745684030.0,2025-04-26 16:13:50
