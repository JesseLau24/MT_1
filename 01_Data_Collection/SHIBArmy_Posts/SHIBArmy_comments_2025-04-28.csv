1ka2cum,NihilistHUGZ,Articles like this are becoming more common as institutional levels of awareness are recognizing Shiba Inu based on its growing utilizations outside of just being a meme where it's Origins began. Shiba Inu has an entire ecosystem that is functioning and is being utilized at many different industrial and institutional levels. I don't know if you all are paying attention but Shiba Inu keeps achieving while you're being blind to the success right before your eyes. There is a pathway for one penny there is a pathway for $1 and all of this is through utilization and you are seeing the beginning steps of a shift in narrative. It's not impossible and unlikely if within a 6-month time frame it was impossible and now everyone's magically aware that it can happen at the institutional levels. The problem is that news pushed a fud/fomo narrative for too long and now retail investors can't get that out of their head. A lot of times these arguments and the points that people are going to make against it are on repeat because they oversimplify something that they don't understand and are too afraid to just say I don't know. You all don't know how much Shiba Inu is going to be worth in any time frame so the fact that you're trying to argue that it'll never reach a dollar is kind of nonsensical. I can at least tell you daily roughly what the price is going to be and how it's going to move and I'm telling you that it will hit some amazing price Targets in the future whether that soon or far off I don't even know but I can tell you that there is a path established right now and it is usable to get there. If you don't believe in Shiba Inu sell your damn tokens and STFU because I would love to DCA some more and have just a little bit lower price and a bunch more tokens.,5,1745870021.0,2025-04-28 19:53:41
1ka2cum,Upnorthwallstreet,It needs to burn 95 percent of its supply and then maybe it will hit a dollar. So to summarize it will never happen. Maybe in 60-70 years.,3,1745869282.0,2025-04-28 19:41:22

1ka2cum,ZootSuitGroot,"“STFU” is the problem. These arguments directly cause hard working people to lose money. Sane people need to NOT STFU just to counter this BS.   Even extreme mass adoption wouldn’t have it CLOSE to a buck. “mass adoption” is going to push SHIB to OVER 150x Apple’s market capitalization? JFC, that is idiocy.   $500,000,000,000,000 - that’s not going to happen. Pure nonsense.   I guess whatever it takes to scam poor people out of their money.  So you are either a scammer or the scammed.  Probably the latter. At some point these scams become self-sustaining with folks like you screaming “buy buy buy” lining the pockets of those *very same people who scammed you.*  So, yea, keep dollar cost averaging and I’m sure it will hit a buck one day for you.",1,1745879274.0,2025-04-28 22:27:54
1ka2cum,NihilistHUGZ,You do know that you create a paradox by saying it will never happen but then you literally follow it up with maybe in 60 to 70 years. That's how long people hold Investments when they hold it as a long-term investment. You have a very narrow and confusing way of oversimplifying something that can actually be accomplished and there is a framework for how it can happen so never is never going to be a good way to make this case.,4,1745869606.0,2025-04-28 19:46:46

1ka2cum,NihilistHUGZ,"I feel like I am in a weird episode here and you are twisting this. I do A DAILY ANALYSIS. I scrape the ENTIRE internet to get the SHIB and ecosystem articles gathered and then I analyze all those articles for a SENTIMENT OUTLOOK SCORE. I created the algorithm for that Indicator. That title uses in a satirical way very real articles that use TA and other supporting fact-based data points to show that 1 cent and 1 dollar are GOING TO HAPPEN. The ecosystem will make it happen. I have read all of those articles so when ‘ME’ not anyone else says that institutions are changing the narrative for like the past month or 2 because the way they were capitalizing on the FUD/FOMO started to make them destroy the industry and erode investor confidences.    That all changed when people started capitulating from the market and they lost readers. To build up the base they stopped the emotionally charged SHILL and started alleviating that and your arguments are from the ‘OLD GUARD’ news articles pre-shift in narrative.    Bet you didn’t know that huh?! But I do and I did when I made my comment.    You didn’t do YOUR diligence with me.    This is not a simple asset anymore, but this subreddit still is. The asset is moving on with serious SHIB investors following and evolving in synergy with the growth. You need to get on board and begin relearning what you know about SHIB and the ecosystem and realize me being here means that serious people are getting involved. I come with an entire trading strategy that is so honed it became my hobby! Don’t get so sore either. I am right and you are wrong. I helped you see that. You are welcome.",1,1745885593.0,2025-04-29 00:13:13
1ka2cum,Fight_FactoryFF,1 cent is possible not 1 dollar to be clear but 1 cent with burning could happen,2,1745871724.0,2025-04-28 20:22:04
1ka2cum,NihilistHUGZ,"Now its to be clear... I dont think you REALLY know what is possible with SHIB because believe it or not the roadmap for 1 cent is the same road map the leads to $1. If 1 cent is possible then so is $1. In time, there is a threshold where utilizations and burns start to have a compounding effect on price appreciation. Once the entire ecosystem has found its prime utilization it will fuel a scarcity boom that is built in to the system. All an investor has to do is HOLD and when the institutions start pushing SHIB closer to that threshold it will be similar to a Bitcoin Halving. This is basically the 1920s as far as relation to advancement levels in comparison to modern age economic structures. Evolution takes more time than a retail investor can bare but remember every big money asset that you always hear I wish I would bought that back in the 90s or years back.... That is literally SHIB and all of its accompanying ecosystem tokens RIGHT NOW and you are missing the moment while you ride the 'it isn't possible wagon' and its not even your original idea. Stop being the sounding board for a mute point PLEASE!",-2,1745875013.0,2025-04-28 21:16:53

1ka2cum,NihilistHUGZ,Thats  cool you made a profit when it was a MEME and you were buying basically a small cap asset with high volatility expecting a quick profit.

1ka2cum,Fight_FactoryFF,"Yeah i sold before it was a blue chip but don't offense to what I said if you understand total market cap and how it equates to circulating supply and global liquidity even if they burn 70 percent which they won't even burn half 1 dollar is never happening 1 cent maybe maybe in our lifetime next 50 years or so but I do like Shiba as a blue chip and long term investment but you will be lucky to see a 5x if alt season kicks off soon, sorry that's just the reality",1,1745881491.0,2025-04-28 23:04:51
1ka2cum,NihilistHUGZ,"I take no offense but rather a pure wide eyed disbelief due to the way you characterized the outlook potential to a ‘never’. You’re now assuming that I don’t understand the way these technicals make up the asset. This only further details how narrow minded you are by saying that it is just a straight forward ‘it has to be burned’ mentality. The ecosystem has functionality to burn the SHIB tokens *read this part closely* AUTOMATICALLY BASED ON THE UTILIZATION OF THE ECOSYSTEM.   You fail to see ‘THAT’ point. The tokens that are apart of the SHIB ecosystem are being utilized by government level institutions and by corporations for transactions. These are just the early days too. Once the full breadth of the project is being utilized it will burn the tokens from the fees and I have broken down the hypothetical math on that and now THRICE I will copy and paste my own great point that makes this a reality with PURE DYOR MATH   “I posted this one a while back but the logic is the same concept and I dont want to redo this math so here it is 'copy/paste'   ""I got one for you! I know you've all heard the, ""What if Shiba Inu was the price of Bitcoin""... no one ever factored in the burns did they?? If you take as a hypothetical future base valuation for SHIB and the ecosystem the current valuation of BTC the burns could be extremely impactful to cost and scarcity. Think about this:    If SHIB has a market cap of $7.77 billion and 123330500 tokens are burned upon each 100 BONE it works out like this    12330500 / $7770000000 = 0.001586 tokens burned roughly per day per $ of market cap    Now lets factor that down with BTC by market caps    1.65 / 7.77 = 0.2122 proportionally   0.2122 * 1000 = 212.2 factor rate   212.2 * 12330500 = 2616532100 future tokens per burn initiated    Going even further in to hypothetical proportionality     212.2 factor * $0.00001322 (Current SHIB Price) = $0.00281 per token if the market cap of SHIB gets to the current $1.65 trillion market cap of BTC and that would only require industrial and governmental levels of utilization of the current ecosystem to generate burns over several years.    I didn’t factor in the scarcity factoring to the increase of price AND I also didn’t add in the intrinsic value the utilizations would be valued at adding even more to the potential price. That’s just business as usual and remember SENTIMENT IS KING….AND… I didn’t add that either. Objectively in the years ahead SHIB priced at $0.00281 a token is extremely realistic!""    This shows that as the market cap increases while coupled with burns from ecosystem utilization the whole thing is more than achievable. Not if but when will it happen is the better question to ask.”     And stop oversimplifying an asset you VERY obviously dont grasp the evolution, funtionality, or utility potential of. I dont expect a quick profit anymore because its not a highly volatile asset like when you sold. SHIB is stabilizing itself to be a solid store of value asset.    I will finish my trading guide and there will be a physical representation of my principles, fundamentals and more concepts about being an investor than you think I know to support my case in this discussion. I dont care your profits or what you do but your words are like a childs crayon drawing to me and I am genuinely shocked you put it out for someone like me to find! ",1,1745884706.0,2025-04-28 23:58:26
