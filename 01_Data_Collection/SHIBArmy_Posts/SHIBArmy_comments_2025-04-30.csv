1kb6lv5,NihilistHUGZ,I have no problem with AI but that would take the fun out of my hobby and I prefer the crayons. There is something about seeing the patterns and the values of different indicators coming together and being able to identify them based on the framework of so many brilliant and passionate people that make up these studies. Their concepts are what I enjoy and like an artist they each created something that is unique and without imitation. It wouldnt be the same if I couldn't try to make my own art and as an artist uses paper I use charts and my methodologies I invent are the artistic expression of my intellect and the reflection of my passion.,1,1746333410.0,2025-05-04 04:36:50

1kb2k0p,NihilistHUGZ,I drove and got a generator from my fathers property and I dont get to use it. Sad because i was going to take my computer on the back porch and do the analysis but the power was back on!,6,1745982723.0,2025-04-30 03:12:03
1kb2k0p,NihilistHUGZ,I am a different breed! I got power and i have to go over my entire portfolio and journal all my trades. My job is being a day trader and as part of my freelance I mange portfolios and run a very private investment group that teaches others how to invest based on a system I created. As part of my job I have to analyze SHIB so I decided to make that part of my job a fun way to teach others. It has to be done either way and I'm not a whiner. No damage to me and my family is safe... no time to stand around when its time to do work,4,1745978273.0,2025-04-30 01:57:53
1kb2k0p,NihilistHUGZ,My clients could care less at least. They just want the numbers at the end of the day! ðŸ˜Ž,5,1745978324.0,2025-04-30 01:58:44
