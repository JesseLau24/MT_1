1fwk1y9,beetlebadascan05,"If by moon you mean .000024, it's about a 6/8 month wait. Then she'll have to land and refuel around .000013. But then it'll be BACK TO THE MOON BABY at .000024ish then she'll have to land and refuel.   you see there's money to be made with shib. But it's not by hodl if you catch my drift.   People need to adjust their perception of where the moon is.   I have 2 accounts with 250 mil tokens each   One I hold just in case. One I trade with the roller coaster ride.

So step 1 is consider how high the market cap could reasonably be. 20B, 100B, 1T, etc. Then take that number and divide it by the number of coins in circulation to see what the price could reasonably reach.   Simple answer, anyweheee in the ballpark of 0.1 to 0.0001 is best described as impossible to next to impossible.

1gt8hdn,Argus24601,"Realistically, maybe drop another couple of zeros, $0.001 tops. If SHIB had the market cap of BTC today, the price would be $0.002997. That's about 113X from where it is right now. So, as crypto adoption increases, and if they burn enough SHIB, yeah, maybe it could get to  $0.0005, by 2030 or longer, but I'm not sure how likely that is. If you 10X from here in the next few years, I'd consider that a big win, if you want to hold onto it until retirement age (if it even survives it that long) then maybe you'll 50X to around $0.0012. Kind of the way google and apple stockholders who bought in 2001 still have their shares.  If you thought you'd strike it big from buying $500 of SHIB anytime after it was listed on major CEX's, it ain't gonna happen. You needed to buy within a month of launch to make moves like that, back when it had 10 zeros after the decimal. But turning $500 into $30K over 25 years, sure, it's possible. It's the 11th most popular coin in the world right now, so it has a decent chance of surviving. For SHIB, it's going to be about holding long term.",10,1731875305.0,2024-11-17 20:28:25

1gple1c,Beastbadmf,It’s impossible at its current volume. Keep the faith and continue to burn. The burn rate is not the end all be all either. There are so many coins that you’d have to 10x the current rate to even mark this up to a reasonable price in the next 10 years. Bitcoin does well because it is a store of wealth. Shiba could go well if it became a way of spending. As many coins as there are. You’ll have to make it a way for people to spend their money.,3,1731682233.0,2024-11-15 14:50:33

ni1ken,[deleted],Thanks to the big dip I was able to buy like 3-4x more than I would have been able to buy.

I got a bunch of people to buy in. As of today I'm up over $765,000. I called this the Doge Killer very early on. Prior to me calling it that, I never heard that saying. Too bad I can't take credit for the name. When I started mentioning shiba inu on reddit all I read was: what is this coin? Who sells it? How many zeros is it at? You got how many coins, over 16 billion??? I jokingly said Fuck I'm a Whale Now!! Never expecting it to go up Sooo fucking fast! I told my friends in time probably 1-2yrs this coin will make me a multimillionaire! Well when it hits just two more zeros, I will make over $22 million!! Pleeeez powers above do Not let me get Screwed on this coin!! I plan on helping alot of people I know that need money. My brother keeps the transactions on his phone and wallet. I pick the coins, pay for them, and he does the transactions. I'm waaaaay to stupid to do that. I guess I have a crazy six sense for picking crypto.

They don’t care much about interviews so I can just walk up there and walk back home knowing I’ll have a job secured without worrying about wasting energy.

1hgeblw,Ok-Film-229,"I agree with this. I’ve invested quite a bit into SHIB hoping for the future.  I’ve also done a lot of research to understand in order to make some significant gains I’m going to need to invest a hell of a lot more.   SHIB needs to burn off a lot of coins. I was doing the math which may not be a hundred percent accurate but they would need to burn off enough coins to set the market cap at 100 billion to even get the price to .001. 99.98% of the supply would need to be burned.   Burns are currently at around 10-50 million a day.. which is extremely slow. I read somewhere that they were planning to speed this up but can’t remember where.   There are various other factors too like utility and demand. It’s definitely possible in the coming years for it to take off, I’m hopeful but, I’m not at the edge of my seat. This is definitely a set and forget situation.  It’s not being pessimistic it’s being realistic. If you invested and want to leave then so be it, maybe they will start implementing a burn rate for transactions as well.

1hfegbe,YoOow28,"I am not necessarily hating on SHIB and still own a bit, but I am happy I pulled most of it out.   This coin is never gonna go anywhere and people need to understand that you're not gonna make much more money out of it anymore. The hypetrain passed a looooooooooong time ago.   Just look at the facts and you'll understand..   Don't get me wrong, this coin is still very interesting for people who like to high risk invest a fuck ton of money to 2x their investment. For people who invest like 50 bucks: you're not gonna make a lot of money with it.   To be completely honest, it's only interesting and actually profitable for big whales.   Simple fact:  - Bitcoin went up 78% in the last 90 days It surpassed it's all time high multiple times and crossed the 100k mark.   - Ethereum went up 73% in the last 90 days.  It's about to cross the 4k mark again.   Both Ethereum and Bitcoin should have rocket SHIB to or at least close to it's all time high.. instead it went up 105% which is not bad but unless you invested a good sum of money, it didn't made that much money. Most of shiba holders are 50-100$ investors hoping it to reach 0,01 somehow (impossible but that's another story).   Therefore you can say: this coin is not gonna X10, x20.. or whatever amount you've got in your head.   If it would it would've already made a big jump to that.   I even doubt if it's all time high will ever be reached again.   So unless you're willing to risk and invest your house, if you want to high risk and invest in meme coins, go look at new released coins and hope you won't get rugpulled.

1hfegbe,YoOow28,"Proving you right about creating a chatgpt account? You do know how ChatGPT/AI works right??   The only thing ChatGPT is doing is to create a somewhat logical story about all the information that has been put out on the internet. It uses those resources to create a possible scenario to come to the conclusion of your question..   It doesn't mean it knows what the coin is about to do.   Simple math:   If we keep a price of let's say 0,000025 and say we're gonna times that by x150   So 0,000025 x 150 = 0,00375 (new price)  With the current supply this means we will have to x150 the current market cap too.   The marketcap at 0,000025 would be around 14 billion.   So 14 billion x 150 = 2,1 trillion dollar Marketcap.   Bitcoin has a marketcap of 2,1 trillion. That would mean it would be the same or surpass Bitcoin in marketcap value..   There is just no way that that's a possibility. There are no plans / indications for it to reach that.. if you wanted to make a million bucks with this coin you would've had to invest a couple bucks at the release of Shib. It's not gonna happen anymore. Unless you're willing to risk like 100-200k dollars. In that case it could be possible.",-1,1734438061.0,2024-12-17 12:21:01

1hfegbe,YoOow28,"Seriously bro, are you actually for real or just trolling because you just can't be this blind to logic and basic understanding of how crypto / coin volumes etc. work..  Sure Bitcoin will rise in price, SOME altcoins may follow.. but SHIB has too many coins in circulation to be one of those coins..   For the last time: for SHIB to gain that much in price: over 25% of the circulating supply (so the coins that YOU are holding) have to be burned (GONE, in the bin, with currently no rewards for doing so).   So a simple question: are you willing to throw away 25% of the coins that YOU are holding?   Keep in mind: you must trust the whole community to do the same otherwise it is just money lost and thrown away and it won't even move the coin by 0,000000000001.   That's what NEEDS to be done to get to the point what you expect the coin would do.   This is something that has been spoken about for years.. but it's just not realistic.   Most of the supply is in the hands of really big whales that bought at the release of the coin. They are the people who can change this but they won't because of the simple fact that they can make a stable flow of money without rugpulling the coin. They make millions off the backs of the small holders. It's really simple to see/understand why this coin is actually still a thing.. same for DOGE.

1hfegbe,YoOow28,"You must be delusional..   The only way for shib to 150x now is if 25% or more of the supply somehow vanishes.. SHIB had some traction in the past because it had this friendly feud with Doge community and it acted on Elons tweets about Doge and pretended it was meant for shib, also it was newly released and there were a lot of plans on the table.   It also helped when Vitalek Buterin burned all the coins that were given to him. That created a little stability.   But since that hype and since it's all time high SHIB has only gone down hill with a couple surges back to the current value. It has never gone close to it's all time high since, even now when crypto is booming and most cryptos are surpassing their ATH's SHIB is still not even close to it's ATH..   Most of the projects/plans have been released and have flopped. Barely anything is in the pipeline and the only reason this coin is still alive is because it's community and faulty misleading articles that somehow create this delusional idea that this coin is going to x100. There is no way it will unless coins are being burned by the trillions a day.. but there is no reward for it to be burned so there is no reason to do it. Only big whales can change the trajectory of this coin by burning their supply. Unless SHIB comes up with a reward there is no reason they will burn their investment and they will only manipulate the market to trick fools into buying a couple 100 or a couple 1000 bucks of Shib to just dumb their trillions again, rebuy at the dip to keep it alive and do the same trick over and over again.

1hdxurx,Burning-Gundam,"Hello there. Since many people are not giving you a straight answer, I'll try my best.   To answer your question. NO. You will not make significant or life changing money with your $10. You would need to invest thousands of dollars at a lower cost. Also, it is important to note that it is best to buy when the token is massively down in price in order to accumulate more and sell when it goes up.   What you need to understand is that SHIB has a massive amount of coins in circulation. There are about 589 TRILLION coins. Bitcoin is where it is because there are only 21 million coins. Also, Bitcoin has been accepted as a coin that has utility, for example, being used for payments. Also, the gas fees to use Bitcoin are a lot less than SHIB.  The only thing that could move the price up is the developers creating a system to burn SHIB tokens in massive amounts. At the current burn rate, it could take hundreds of years for SHIB to reach a penny. Possibly even thousands of years.   The more tokens people buy, the more tokens are burned, reducing the circulating supply. But it is not enough. People would need to buy SHIB in massive amounts in order to burn tokens faster. Again, the developers need to come up with a way to burn tokens faster.   Sorry to break it to you, but you will never see a penny. There's nothing wrong with holding some, but $10 is not going to help you. I had around 150 million tokens because I kept buying $10 every week for years. I sold everything because it was not going to get to a value worth enough for me to hold. I made 2k in profits, so I converted everything into XRP and HBAR.  Look into better projects like ETH, XRP, ADA, or HBAR. Even holding some COMP would not be a bad idea, considering there's only 8.8 million tokens in circulation. That's less than half of what Bitcoin has. Diversify in better tokens with a more promising outcome.   You can still get in better projects. But you can still hold on to your SHIB and add a little bit here and there to see where it goes. Hope this helped. Good luck. 👍",1,1734226639.0,2024-12-15 01:37:19

That is why it is impossible in this day.  The only ways for it to reach $1 would be decades of rapid inflation for global currencies resulting in the market cap for shib to reach $1 being worth less than 1% of global gdp, OR if 99.999% of all shib was removed from the market aka burned.

Some people make a few bucks here and there by taking out at every rise and buying back in at every dip but that only gets you minimal gains…maybe 15-60 buckere here and there depending on how much money you’re investing. If you wanna see real gaines it would take alot of investment up front and steady investments weekly or monthly on the dips and waiting  over time for the long haul. Im talking about 1-3 years of holding and investing depending on the rate at wich it rises to see a substantial increase. You must be prepared to invest over 1,000 dollars, and you must also be aware and understand that you very well could lose all of it. Its lost a few zero’s since i started investing, and i will stand to make a few hundred thousand dollars if it loses 2 more zeros. The golden spot that everyone is hoping for is the .01 cent mark. For example bit coin started less then 1 cent in 2010 but now is over 100k per coin. Had someone purchased 1,000 dollars worth and cashed out today that’s enough money for 10 different familes to live for 5 generations …so its about the long haul.",1,1734154798.0,2024-12-14 05:39:58

1gy6f0m,Canadianretordedape,"What a thrilling and challenging hypothetical scenario! To spearhead a roadmap to get SHIB to $1 within 5-10 years, I’d implement the following steps:  *Phase 1 (Years 1-2): Building Foundations*  1. Establish a strong governance structure for the SHIB community, including a decentralized decision-making process. 2. Develop a clear roadmap with milestones and key performance indicators (KPIs). 3. Foster partnerships with reputable organizations to enhance credibility. 4. Launch a robust marketing campaign focusing on SHIB’s unique features and use cases. 5. Develop and implement a token burn mechanism to reduce supply and increase value.  *Phase 2 (Years 2-4): Ecosystem Expansion*  1. Develop and launch a decentralized exchange (DEX) and liquidity pool to enhance trading and liquidity. 2. Create a SHIB-based lending and borrowing platform. 3. Establish a SHIB-themed gaming and NFT ecosystem. 4. Launch a SHIB-powered payment gateway for merchants. 5. Expand the SHIB community through strategic partnerships and outreach programs.  *Phase 3 (Years 4-6): Scaling and Adoption*  1. Develop and implement sharding or layer 2 scaling solutions to enhance transaction capacity. 2. Launch a SHIB-based stablecoin to reduce volatility. 3. Establish partnerships with mainstream businesses for real-world adoption. 4. Develop a comprehensive education and training program for SHIB users. 5. Host annual SHIB conferences and hackathons to foster innovation.  *Phase 4 (Years 6-10): Maturity and Global Recognition*  1. Achieve listing on top-tier exchanges and secure regulatory compliance. 2. Launch a SHIB-based decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. 3. Establish a SHIB-themed venture capital fund for blockchain startups. 4. Host a SHIB-themed global festival to celebrate adoption and community growth. 5. Continuously monitor and adapt to market trends and technological advancements.  Measures to ensure success:  1. Regular progress tracking and community updates. 2. Adaptable governance structure to address emerging challenges. 3. Continuous investment in research and development. 4. Strong community engagement and incentivization programs. 5. Strategic partnerships and collaborations.  Failure is not an option! With a well-structured roadmap, dedicated community, and adaptability, we can achieve the goal of reaching $1 within 5-10 years.

To accomplish this, I would:  1.1: Conduct a community survey to understand the current governance structure, identify pain points, and gather feedback on desired changes.  1.2: Research and analyze existing governance models in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space, such as DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations), to determine the most suitable framework for SHIB.  1.3: Propose a governance structure that includes:  a) A decentralized decision-making process using a voting system (e.g., token-based voting or delegate-based voting).  b) A council or board comprising representatives elected by the community, responsible for overseeing governance and making strategic decisions.  c) Clear roles and responsibilities for community members, including contributors, moderators, and developers.  d) A transparent and auditable decision-making process, ensuring accountability and trust.  1.4: Develop a governance token (e.g., SHIB-GOV) to enable community members to participate in voting and decision-making processes.  1.5: Implement a decentralized governance platform (e.g., DAOstack, Aragon) to facilitate voting, proposal submission, and decision-making.  1.6: Establish a dispute resolution process to address conflicts and ensure community cohesion.  1.7: Foster a culture of open communication, transparency, and inclusivity, ensuring all community members have a voice and are encouraged to contribute.  1.8: Review and refine the governance structure regularly, incorporating community feedback and adapting to evolving needs.  By following these steps, we can create a robust governance structure that empowers the SHIB community, ensures decentralized decision-making, and sets the foundation for a successful and sustainable ecosystem.",3,1732405644.0,2024-11-23 23:47:24

1gva8iw,BigMacNoOnions,"Well my question would be, what was the price when you put 2,000 in? Did you sell it? Or are you still holding that initial 2,000 in shiba?   I can go to the app, and see what the price was at the end of 2020. Divide 2,000 by the price (I just picked a day at the end of 2020 since you said you bought it at end of 2020) so I'm picking a 0.0000000001 and that would give you around 20,000,000,000,000 coins. If you sold that at mid May 2021 when it was at 0.00001 or mid September at 0.00009 then you would've had you at $200,000,000 or 1,800,000,000 (this is just the peak prices at those time.   Again, I would need more information like what price you bought in at and what price you sold at, if you did sell.   Fractions on fractions makes a huge different if there's a vast different like what is said above. If the margin is small, then obviously it makes no difference.   I bought $250 Doge at 0.0022 and never thought it would go high like it did, and I sold it and got roughly 79,500 before taxes/fees. Fractions do make a difference, especially if you put a lot in to where the gains are massive.",1,1740091285.0,2025-02-20 22:41:25

Each time I made more and more money because every time it was doubled of what I had at that current time. Made over 22k in 4 years after taxes. If you ask me, I think over time that can buy a new car or used for a nice head start in the stock market. Idk that's what I use crypto for, money in crypto holding, but then when it's low I double what I have for predicted hikes and dips.

1gv1u6l,Austoman,"Just so everyone reading this BS knows. These kind of numbers, when used on actual stocks with genuine value (revenue, expenses, etc), are determined through a historical analysis of the stocks performance over the past 5 years/60 months. That type of historical analysis is considered one of the weaker forms of financial analysis but is used as a starting point to further analyze market trends, new releases, and industry events that may impact the stock.  When you attempt to use that form of analysis on a speculation based item, such as crypto currency, it loses all value as there is no underlying real value being tracked historically. All there is is speculation, and historical trending does nothing with current public opinion.   Furthermore, again there has been no additional commentary or reasoning for the numbers being listed (provable impactful events, industry trends and their relation to the specific item, etc). At best the 'prediction' is using a financial analysis that doesnt work with the item (crypto currency), meaning that the numbers are meaningless.    So, tldr.

1duunvo,dontttttknow,"Yes! This unfortunately Will take a little while but will happen. I have seen this coin since it was first sold on coinbase - (coincloud digital atm) i dont know if it's the same, but coin cloud went bankrupt is all i know. I have destroyed hundreds of millions over the last few years. I was fortunate enough to buy it before it was easily accessible. I cant remember how much i had gotten but $75 etheirum swapped to shiba at that price got me quite a lot of them. I honestly can't remember. I do remember buying the coin, saying "" this will take a while ill just forget about it and check on it every week"" a week later i opened the wallet and nearly died. I saw the spike and couldn't believe that i was technically a multi-million air for the entire time i was not looking at the app. I did transfer a large amount of coins to random wallets i found on shibburn. I looked at my girlfriend at the time and said ""ha ha i just sent x amount of coins to a bunch of random wallets. I want to freak them out"" ""IDGAF, I'm mad at you for even buying it in the first place. Im done rolling, lets smoke""  that had beyond pissed me off and is why i remember that event so well, other than that, she had gotten me extremely high every night for 2 years straight. That is why I can't fully remember what happened but i broke the phone i was using at the time and couldn't get back into the wallet. I gave up on it for a year or 2 came back,  and lost both of my wallets i had made. thankfully i burnt 85%-95% of them before losing said wallets. I recently got ahold of the last last last one i made. I had 37 million in my wallet. I bought more coins then looked at the Shiba burn rate and said ""someone has got to do something about this"" then proceeded to burn i believe close to 50 million coins over 2 days.

Reddit, when it comes to American politics is heavily far left. They will get all information solely based off a headline and a little more off sources that are left wing bias. So if anything you should expect most users on this website to be heavily propagandized. If you just asked a normal person off the internet how they are doing in bidens economy they are more often then not going to side with trump and say biden is doing a horrible job which is accurate. But if you expect that logic on Reddit you are gravely mistaken. You will most likely find people with trump derangement syndrome that will find any way to gas light you into blaming trump for bidens failures. At the end of the day if you hear people blaming trump for todays problems then you have to realize Biden should be able to do something to make it better and take accountability.

That does too much irresponsible spending with bloated bills having unnecessary things that aren’t helping the economy and contradicting the purpose of the spending. Also democrats control most if not all of big tech so they censor opposition (republicans) as much as they can while not properly fact checking liberal sources. Also the democrat party is my body my choice unless it’s an experimental shot that has made revelations of causing all the harm people were previously outspoken about. Democrats cling on the false premise that they are the lesser of 2 evils and would rather vote out of spite instead of logic, prime example. A geriatric dementia patient that needs cognitive stimulants to read off a teleprompter is our president just because people eat up all the propaganda about trump.

1danhqn,redguy4545,Yeah you don’t understand what I meant at all. I understood what you said fine. Ironically I have to do the same thing you tried to do. Here’s me breaking it down for you. You “investors in shib” have to say things like “holdddd” and other phrases to encourage people and yourself not to sell. If it was a solid investment that you truly believed in why do you result to using hype to make yourselves believe? If it was actually going up to .01 then you wouldn’t have to say it. But you do say it cus you want to convince others of your delusional ideals. And sure if it goes up you can come back and say I’m wrong but so could so many crap cryptos if they go up. A lot of the crap won’t. This investment isn’t an inesvtmemt it’s a gamble and I think a lot of you crypto users know it deep down.

1i7p5kz,JDizzytwenty10,I keep seeing this trobits thing. Can someone tell me how it works and is it legit,3,1737603776.0,2025-01-23 03:42:56
1i7p5kz,trobits,"Very good question. The short version of the answer is: Trobits is a crypto website that uses money from advertisements to buy and burn SHIB $ LUNC  The detailed answer is:  We, SHIB &amp; LUNC holders want to see the price go up and even hit the mythical $1. The truth of the matter is that with the current supply, the $1 is simply impossible. That would be more money than the whole world!  However, if the current total supply (trillions and trillions of coins) is drastically reduced (to billions), then the $1 dream becomes a possibility. Burning SHIB &amp; LUNC is nothing new. Binance burns about 1billion LUNC every month. Shibarium was actually built to burn SHIB. The Terra Luna Classic community has passed several “Tax2Burn” propositions. The problem is that these proposals(Binance,Shibarium etc) rely on people spending money in order for them to have the money they need to burn the coins. For example, Binance charges roughly 0.1% - 0.5% fee when you buy or sell LUNC on their platform. They use about half of that to burn LUNC. Same thing with Shibarium; they charge for every transaction on the platform and a very small fraction is used for burning SHIB. This means we (the community) have to spend billions of dollars every month to buy and sell the coins on those platforms. That’s the problem!  At Trobits, we came up with a simple idea. What if we can get the community to participate in the burns by contributing time instead of money. That is why we built a platform to provide general crypto info, price quotes, news etc. As the community uses the platform (to do what they already do on other platforms), we generate money through ads and use that to burn the coins.   Now, for this to work, we need some key elements: 1. Traffic: For us to generate any substantial amount,we need heavy traffic to the platform. Luckily, it is estimated that there are about 1.5 million SHIB holders and 5 million LUNC holders. If we have 1 million people visiting the website every day, we would be burning trillions of SHIB and billions of LUNC every month! Just to put things into perspective, CoinMarketCap has over 10 million page views per day!  2, Transparency: If someone tells you they are going to do something, it’s ok to have doubts. At Trobits, we don’t tell you what we do. We show you! The burn addresses for SHIB &amp; LUNC are general knowledge. You can simply Google it. We give you the transaction reference for verification. Thank God, nothing is hidden in this open ledger called the Blockchain. We challenge anyone in the whole wide world to check it out and tell us if we did not burn the coins as shown! We will burn every single day and display the information on the website. We want people to come every day to verify!  3. Time: We all want to be millionaires today. Unfortunately, even with aggressive burns, this will take some time. Maybe 5 years to get to $1 if we all get involved. If you burn 100 billion LUNC or 1 trillion SHIB, that will be less than 0.01% of what is out there. We need time in order to burn a significant amount. Don’t expect price to jump immediately. Time is very important.  This is a long answer but one last thing. Just to be clear: At Trobits we are not doing this simply for the love of the community. We love you guys but let’s be real. We own these coins individually. If SHIB &amp; LUNC should get to $1, we would be multi millionaires. That is why we have spent money to build the platform and obtain a patent ( oh, yes, we have a patent). We have a vested interest in this project.   Check it out. Run the numbers.  Do the math. If you think there’s something we should be doing, we would love to hear from you!  Welcome to Trobits, where we earn to burn (www.trobits.com)",3,1737631276.0,2025-01-23 11:21:16

Not only with this increase the traffic of shib purchases because people would obviously have to buy shib to be able to spend it in the game but allowing that money being spent to finance the ship coming in that could then be turned around and burned will also increase the price.",1,1737669274.0,2025-01-23 21:54:34

1ilkqqi,trobits,"Burning simply means permanently removing coins from circulation; the coins are lost forever. It is a mechanism often employed to reduce the circulating supply of a particular coin to boost the price. For example, Shibarium uses a portion of the trading fees to buy back SHIB and burn. Think of it like stock buyback in traditional finance. The difference is that with stock buyback, the company can actually sell those stocks later. However, with crypto burning, the process is irreversible.",2,1739485523.0,2025-02-13 22:25:23

1ilkqqi,trobits,"Not necessarily. Any body can burn a coin. It simply entails sending the coin to a specific burn wallet, from which the coin can never be recovered. At Trobits, we burn SHIB and LUNC coins daily. The concept is simple. We buy the coins using money from advertisements. The more people use the site, the more money we generate from ads and the more coins are burn. We display the information on the site daily. We hope that as we burn the coins, prices will rise. This of course will take time. It’s not a get rich quick scheme. We don’t encourage you to burn your coins!

""Let me throw away 1000's of dollars so people who only invested a couple 100 or a couple 1000 can be rich""   I seriously don't understand how people still think this is a real possibility. The only way to make this happen is if they get a reward in the form of some other coin related to shib (like Bone was in the past) that way their investment isn't thrown into the bin but is actually worth something.   Right now people who have trillions keep making tons of money by selling on high prices, buying in on low prices.. all the normal people keep on failling to realise that and make the whales even more money.

1if6tgv,bettiewilde," I get the skepticism, but the reality is SHIB’s supply is the biggest barrier to price growth. No one is asking people to burn trillions alone—it’s about collective action. If every holder burns their excess SHIB, we all benefit from a higher price per token over time.  That said, burns need incentives to be truly effective. That’s why projects like Shibarium and reward-based burns are so important. Instead of just burning for the sake of it, imagine if SHIB burns were linked to real utility—staking rewards, exclusive access, or other token perks.  And let’s be real: SHIB isn’t dead. With ongoing developments in Shibarium, metaverse integrations, and DeFi expansion, the project still has major growth potential. The whales win because they play the long game—so why shouldn’t the SHIB Army do the same? 🚀🔥",4,1738450059.0,2025-02-01 22:47:39

1eglteq,NihilistHUGZ,"I share your sentiment. Crypto is volatile, and the quick fluctuations can be hard to predict when I just use my charts. I began digging into possibilities and I think a huge factor is greed. There are several coins in presale which make people feel they could have the ‘Lambo’ as soon as they go live. After GameStop, I started noticing short squeezes everywhere. Then I came to crypto, and Shiba Inu in particular, and it was more than I had ever expected. Essentially, large whale accounts and their interests pump up these new cryptos and everyone buys in. Then they dump on all of them and move to the next. Wash, rinse, repeat.  I discovered the United States Government is a huge whale of Shiba Inu. I found that to be the stability I couldn’t find in other cryptos. If it wasn’t for the Shib Army, the whales would have hijacked SHIB. Our organic growth and interest is what keeps us afloat. The clickbait ads seem to be funded by someone with the interest to scare Shiba Inu investors, but the devs and the overall verifiable goals they accomplish tell the truth of our direction. Most investors are not seasoned traders that know what is going on, and they get scared when they think they are going to lose money they can’t afford to lose. That’s another sign of someone who should ‘set it and forget it.’  Gamestop’n Whales Targeted Clickbait Ads Disparaging members in the overall community",1,1722446694.0,2024-07-31 17:24:54

It's not so much what the petition is but the petition itself is simply one of the Shiba Army members that had an idea and now over 1,000 other Shiba Army members have amplified that one voice to be more loud. One of our own felt strong enough to try to make a change and I support that. The 1% token burn is a good idea but the good idea is really that we should show solidarity as a community behind any idea one of our own has.  This petition that someone made is an example of community building and if we were the wisest of communities we would show the world how united we can be on anything. I keep reading the whys and I keep thinking of when my daughter runs up and asks for me to do something with her. Its just the right thing to do. Let Binance figure out what to do, but they will know [Insert Number] Shiba Army members are united and that our power to unite for change leaves quite the impression.

1ed4ats,NihilistHUGZ,They have started that phase of the 'burn' plan. Recently started.

1ed4ats,Cold-Positive-818,You get started from that comment. She stated auto burns would be in last year. They apparently had it in puppy net in January and still no word. If we are relying on this team doing a burn when they feel like it and only burning what they feel like then this is just more lies. They still are sitting on bone from shibarium from when it was hitting some inflated numbers when it launched. Look at how much it's being used now compared to back then.,2,1722531481.0,2024-08-01 16:58:01
1ed4ats,NihilistHUGZ,I believe started as in we are finally rolling somewhere. Lucie gave transparent updates about the actual implementation of burns. After the puppynet transitioned to the Sepolia network the burns became a guarantee. Up until that point they were manual burns. The new technologies we keep advancing into come layered with burn mechanisms. After Mainnet release we had like 8 billion tokens burned. The advancements of the ecosystem are the auto burns we were waiting for. Between Layer 3 and ShibaSwap 2 we should start to see the other layers of our ecosystem start increasing their ability for burns. Bone had to be renounced and now its implementation is seen with Weex. Bone surged double digits after Shibaswap was integrated.,1,1722533007.0,2024-08-01 17:23:27
1ed4ats,Cold-Positive-818,"No she didn't. Never gave proper dates and still hasn't. She stated manual burns from shibarium could be initiated by anyone post the 25000 mark. They rolled back on that. She is the worst marketing lead I every seen. She spins more opium than anyone and no one disagree or question without being shamed or slated. She also said we could be burning 5 trillion a month. Pure mule that will never happen after two cuts to the fees that shibarium is supposed to accurate. There is no transparency with this team. No measurable goals and no communication on key milestones.they are using shib to fill their boots with bone,lease, stupid NFTs and the like.",2,1722540762.0,2024-08-01 19:32:42
1ed4ats,NihilistHUGZ,"Oh, I don’t agree with Lucie if you’re getting that impression. In fact, I got myself banned by her X account earlier for going to bat for this community. She is not presenting their case well, that’s the assessment I’ve taken. With that said, a mumbling man, or woman, may still carry a message, even if they can barely get it out. It’s between the lines, and starting tonight, I will look for information for us all. If it’s not the case, then I am wrong, and she shouldn’t be posting ‘clickbait.’ Through and through, for some reason, I have a big love in my heart for the SHIB community. For now, I concede that you are right about the definitive tone she has presented, but I look at the things that are verifiable, and it feels like there is more than we all know, whether good or bad, we all deserve to know. If we get lied to, then burn it down. If not, then what a ride with so much potential for good. No matter what, we still became ‘The SHIB Army.’",1,1722542013.0,2024-08-01 19:53:33

I anticipate Congressional investigations will look at the future of cryptocurrency, particularly targeting the ‘whales’ who have significantly influenced the market. The crypto movement began organically, but as more money flowed in and regulatory oversight remained minimal, it attracted scepticism. Consequently, new investors, unfamiliar with the differences of cryptocurrencies from traditional stocks, are at risk of financial losses.  Our slice of the market is more secure than the NEW ‘meme coins,’ which are susceptible to rapid inflation and deflation. We call this ‘pump and dump’ schemes.

1e9gcpx,NihilistHUGZ,New Update based on changes in my methodologies. A little more insight for our spectrum of investors.    I have analyzed the ADX for short-term and long-term. So let me cut to it. All of our other indicators show us that we are at a wait and see but they may not have responded to the ADX showing a strong trend coming. We are at ADX 3 day 26.91 and ADX 14 day 28.02. These adx values show that a strong trend is coming. It is in my opinion that indicators are in place that we should prepare for potential volatility and significant price movements. I say that because I have applied some of my best work here even theoretical and we have rose past key indicators. Fibonacci 61.8% at 0.000017 and it even struggled just like we should have on our way to 100% in the sequence. Elliott wave is right there in 3-5 phase. I suspect 4 which is on its way to Phase 5. A high ADX over a longer period would indicate a strong trend pressure. I am not sure of a timeline definitively but with all these indicators I think we are all about to see our investment make a move.   EOD projection holds SAME with potential to test upper Bollinger support of 0.000018 being only slight immediate change suspected. Any bearish indicators that are strong and we could see our 0.000017 support tested again.,1,1721683093.0,2024-07-22 21:18:13

This token piggybacking off of DOGE was kinda the start and i was totally cool with at first cuz on another chain, may have some use case who knows. But everything spiraled out of control.  If we took all the time and money from all the clones and pumped into the actual memes we'd have meme themed lambo car meets.

1h9yrci,Killer_Stickman_89,"Both of your tokens are fucked. The only reason PEPE is ""doing well"" now is because it pretty much just launched. With over 420 Trillion in circulating supply it has essentially no real room for growth either. Unless you bought at launch you won't be making any substantial money off of it.  SHIB and PEPE have a combined amount of nearly 1 Quadrillion in circulating supply. It will never hit 1 cent, it will never hit a tenth of a cent, it will never hit a hundredth of a cent, etc. Theoretically at the current burn rate you'd have to wait around a decade to even have a chance. In which case you've also missed out on multiple bullruns and 10 years worth of entry points in other projects that have an actual future.  Somebody random could put in a ""whopping"" *$20* and essentially have a million of them. The circulating supply of your token is too massive. There are too many theoretically giant bag holders.

1h8nh9z,ChaotiQ78,"I made a ton of doge. Got all my invested monies back and reinvested a lot of the profits I made. The best part of trading crypto is it's 24/7. You can also make quick buys and sell whenever, like day trading. In order to day trade stocks, using Robinhood, you would need $25,000 in the spending account. So stock picks you cannot resale for 24 hours, or you get a strike. 3 strikes equals no access to your account for a month, which I think a literal robbery. So I always sell at a high point with select cryptos and wait for the drop to buy back or move on to the next hyped thing, because pumps and dumps.",5,1733588847.0,2024-12-07 16:27:27

There are no limits, and we can’t base a projected price outcome of a coin based on current market caps and compare it to GDP, etc, etc.   They will keep expanding and breaking these so called barriers. Nothing is impossible in the crypto world and token economics has proven again and again that market caps can be broken to new all time highs.

1h8nh9z,NoxImus421,"While the concerns raised in this message are valid and highlight important risks associated with speculative investments like Shiba Inu (SHIB), there are other perspectives to consider:  1. Utility and Development: While the message claims Shiba Inu has no utility, the ecosystem is actively developing projects such as Shibarium, a Layer-2 blockchain solution, and ShibaSwap, its decentralized exchange. These developments aim to provide utility beyond being a ""meme coin."" Utility is essential for driving adoption and creating long-term value.   2. Burn Mechanisms: The Shiba Inu community has implemented token burn strategies, which reduce the circulating supply over time. As the supply decreases, the price potential increases without requiring an astronomical market cap. While significant burns are necessary, the community's commitment to this approach cannot be dismissed.   3. Market Dynamics: Cryptocurrency markets are highly speculative and can defy traditional financial logic. Assets like Dogecoin, which also started as a meme, have reached significant valuations despite lacking initial utility. Shiba Inu's strong community and branding give it momentum similar to Dogecoin's rise.   4. Investment Strategies: Dismissing SHIB outright ignores the potential for short- or medium-term profits due to market volatility. Many traders profit from small price movements rather than holding for unrealistic goals like $0.01. Educating investors about responsible investing is more effective than discouraging participation outright.   5. The Nature of Crypto: Cryptocurrencies, especially meme coins, are speculative by nature, and many investors participate with the understanding that they are taking a risk. It’s essential to invest only what you can afford to lose, but assuming every investor is unrealistic about the coin’s potential dismisses their ability to make informed decisions.   6. Future Possibilities: While a $0.01 valuation without significant burns is unlikely, it’s important to acknowledge that technological advancements, partnerships, or unforeseen market shifts could enhance Shiba Inu’s value proposition over time.   Responsible Investment Reminder:  While optimism is part of the crypto space, it’s crucial to emphasize risk management and realistic expectations. Investors should:  Research thoroughly.  Diversify their portfolio.  Avoid risking funds they can’t afford to lose.   The key takeaway is balance: acknowledge the risks while also considering the potential opportunities with an informed, cautious approach.",1,1733601998.0,2024-12-07 20:06:38

1e8smf2,NihilistHUGZ,You do have a point and people shouldn't down vote. It is investor sentiment and it influences our investments equally. We should have open dialogues to express the fact of the sentiments. Investors are more confident under Trump and that is highly documented. The point of this post was to draw attention to a decisive influence for our investments. I have highlighted in other posts on Reddit communities the relationship of Bitcoin with SHIB and in February we became highly intertwined. Please be open minded to the sentiments and think through a spectrum of investment potential. Buy dips and i posted at the lowest I seen. They coincided so I posted.

1e8smf2,NihilistHUGZ,No that is way beyond my intent. I will say it plain. I am the messenger bringing a latest development to investors. I am not advocating any candidates. This is to draw attention to sentiment buying. I posted the moment i seen the letter and it was coincidentally the same time SHIB dropped. Then as the news quickly spread the price rose. It was an investment opportunity to see a 0.00000137 increase in per share price and show the price will inevitably be affected by this news. Based on the recent hack and any news where SHIB is influenced is worthy for investment consideration. I've got options calls on other stock I could suggest based on latest news sentiment if you want that instead.,1,1721596772.0,2024-07-21 21:19:32

Based on the SHIB support price vs. current price SHIB did not 'Fail'  Most decentralized assets affected directly or indirectly by these instances held their investment potential when weighed against support prices and the overall greater influence of Bitcoin in relation to investor sentiment was influenced by these instances.,1,1721592969.0,2024-07-21 20:16:09

So if bitcoin is dropping, then most other crypto is going to drop and vice versa when it starts going up, most other crypto will start going up. so if you're invested in something and it starts dropping a lot, take a look at bitcoin and that will tell you a lot.

1d907me,t-walters,"😂 I wish I was. Not sure how it makes me look like I’m trolling. 🤷🏼‍♂️  I stumbled across Shib 2 years ago randomly on something I was doing online. I did some self research via google (probably worse thing I could have done) and landed on Robinhood. Mathematically Shib just seemed too much of an upside for growth potential so I started investing with Robinhood. Where I live in MS I have come across hardly anybody that knows anything about crypto or wallets or any of it.  It just all seems foreign to me. I just don’t want to miss out on cashing out when the time comes because of something not working or me not knowing what to do. Or worse, lose my money I do have invested.   Do y’all think I’m good to just keep riding with Robinhood and pray it’ll still be a thing long term?",1,1717636801.0,2024-06-06 01:20:01

I guess I just sound professional over my responses and inquiries.   I joined Reddit and these subs to seek help and learn more about it. I tried posting this in Shib Army but don’t have the Karma yet. I’ll post there when I get it and maybe somebody there can give me some insight and not just think I’m BSin.   I guess there are people out there that have time to make up something up for a post but I am not one.

To explain that, I’ve been learning about crypto and since there’s money involved and the market is so volatile this includes in a between the line sort of way. I understand that sounds paranoid and it is. But I’ve seen a lot of posts similar to yours and I know pump and dumps are always a factor to consider. I understand that the reason I’m seeing the similar posts could be for a completely different thing like coincidence or like minded individuals going thru similar things. There’s still so much of this industry I don’t understand. Also I don’t use Reddit often so I’m not used to how people communicate here more of a instagram user or X here.

I’m a simpleton from Mississippi and I’m off social media except for a very rare FB log in once a quarter (I literally got on this because of Shib).   It’s just a hard concept to understand for me because there’s nothing tangible. I can’t go to town to the crypto bank and make a deposit or withdrawal face to face. So that makes me paranoid that I’ve put in a little over a $1000 that is just floating out there in La la land that I’ll never get back. Or even worse, the arbitrary fake thing I purchased actually becomes much more valuable and I can’t cash in on that.   I obviously took a gamble on this (yes I know, don’t put up more than you can afford to lose, I haven’t). But I’d like to understand a little more about this gamble I’ve made because it all confuses me, and if I better understand it I’ll probably buy more.

1d83fhy,[deleted],"Yeah and Bitcoin’s market cap in 2022 was 330b and went to almost 1.4T. Market caps do give us information but won’t effect the price in crypto. Come on. I’m sure people thought the same at a lower level with crypto every time it was at a level and thought it won’t double. And then it does. Bch for instances went from 100 to 700. There just needs to be enough inflow and it will take off. We all have our opinions on the topic, but no one really knows what’s gonna happen plain and simple",1,1717609132.0,2024-06-05 17:38:52

1d3qm0x,Existing_Creme_5888,I do. It’s proven a better strategy especially if I’m trading sums below 10k. Shib along with others can be played like that if you take the time to develope the strategy. I also have long term hold positions too and strongly believe that you should have some. But if you’re only trading 2k why wait 3 years vs take profits and buy larger positions? It’s not easy but I’ve liked those results more then holding and not taking profits. Also it’s helpful in learning to trade and developing your strat - we are here to make money right? lol I don’t get why you guys are so butthurt and act like these strategies haven’t existed since Merril Lynch. Just educate yourselves and have the balls to develope your Strat. Took me a while to realize the value of taking profits because I wanted to not miss out or “it’s better for taxes” lol winning is better for taxes.,2,1717066218.0,2024-05-30 10:50:18

1h4e6qq,ChampOfSon,"Well, Shibarium is mostly a failure, but there is a gas fee to do transactions on there, so a portion of those fees are gathered and used to buy and then burn Shib tokens.  There's a few community members that have done it.  A new token just burned 5.1B Shib tokens as a gimmick to advertise their project.  The only ever real and impact full burn was when Vitalik Buterin burned over 40% od the circulating supply from his half of the Shib token supply that was given to him as an unwanted gift as a symbolic burn in the beginning. That he actually ended up burning the vast majority of those tokens was pretty cool.  IF something like Shibarium were to have billions of dollars of volume a day, the burn mechanism attached to it would be more impactful. But I think it was a major fail for them to make a L2 called Shibarium but then require BONE tokens to be used as the gas. It could have been Shib tokens or even Ethereum but they chose the token they invented and controlled out of greed imo.  Note the Shib ""team"" is just community members that declared themselves as such. The Shiba Inu contract was designed and launched so that there could never be a true owner or team behind the Shib contract.  A selfless community would have built a L2 that used the Shib token itself making it more accessible to people to use. Or just Ethereum like BASE does in Coinbase's L2. Base has a lot of volume as a result and imagine if something like Shiabariim existed with a lot of volume and a burn mechanism attached to that volume.",1,1733262855.0,2024-12-03 21:54:15

1h41h5h,Affectionate_Seat959,"You know who the Shib whales are? Besides Big exchanges that want inventory to sell to their retail customers like you and I. Exchanges love this because they make a ton of money with people buying and selling in fees. Eth holders love it because those who transfer Shib to cold wallet pay eth for fees which burns eth supply. A Shib whale as an individual is not someone that took actual 21 million dollars and bought Shib. They took eth that they have had and bought at $1 or mined in early days and exchanged it for Shib. They don’t really care about Shib. They are buying Shib to burn eth supply to made their eth more valuable and go up. These gentlemen and ladies have millions and some even have billions in Eth value to exchange. Every time eth is exchanged on eth blockchain eth percentage is burned this includes any crypto that uses eth block chain like Shib, lessen the supply of Eth making it go up in value. Eth is stalled and not going up as fast as Bitcoin is. If Shib goes up then that is extra for them, For Shib, we need to burn a lot of the supply by using their block chain on their exchange. Anyone here doing that? Anyone here staking their Shib there? Also The problem is the people Shib Devs that control how much is burned; it is not automatic like eth block chain. Someone there has to push the key to burn Shib by sending it to the dead wallet.  Any volunteers that wanna burn their Shib? Anyway it will be a very long time before burns through two zeros. Maybe 2026 one zero or close to it like .00009 for a few months. I see Shib as that hot girl friend or boy friend that is big tease. All tokens that are on exchanges will do well this coming year. My advice is look at the chart history for Shib to know best time to buy. Right now and coming weeks are going to be interesting.

And the only real reason why everyone says this is bullshit is because they're astounded by it's success to catch on, and so it's pretty much just the wider financial world saying.... ""nuh uh.... it can't be legitimate.  It's all based on nothing.""  As if money itself is based on something other than faith...  That's like the pot calling the kettle black...  Bitcoin brought crypto, as a whole, legitimacy.  This boom here, after a crash that many thought could wipe crypto out, or at least knock it back to an obscure risky thing, is only happening because trust, faith, and legitimacy.  No sane person would turn down 10 bitcoin, just willingly given to them.  Why?  Because... it is universally accepted, just like money, that this would have extreme value.  Shiba, Doge, Pepe, etc.... they're the next ones up, to become real legitimate global currencies that have value, pretty much anywhere in the world, even if they're harder to transact at the moment...  Bitcoin is fortunate in that it literally has the nation of El Salvador using it as a national currency.  Any nation, even a city, or town, that transacts primarily in a particular crypto, breathes a ton of life into it.  What happens when Guatemala or Costa Rica adopt Doge or Shiba?  Their economies, just like El Salvador, as a whole, will become more prosperous, and the currency will spike in value, and mine and yours investment and faith in this will have helped bring that to them.  I've been to Afghanistan, and it sucks, but even the Taliban could adopt something like this, and both they and I, would prosper greatly financially speaking.  It would've been a funny topic to bring up when I had previously met with warlords 20 years ago...  I wonder if they would've shot at us less, if we helped make each other rich...  I bet El Salvadorians aren't going to be coming across the border as much in the coming years.... Crypto will have played a roll in that, in spite of all of the ""nuh uh's, it's bullshit!

Buy back in if you want after but DO NOT hard focus on this token. It's going no where this bullrun and I mean that as is in its getting left behind. I thought SHIB would be in a better spot all these years but the community SOMEHOW didn't care or do anything about their tokens having a circulating supply of almost 600 Trillion FOR OVER 4 YEARS!  Trump owns a fuck load of ETH and he is going to be President of The United States.

We will not know what direction the market is going in 2025 until post Trump inauguration. That is going to be on Jan 20, 2025. If there is some serious price movement leading up to that moment the floor is going to raise exponentially. Meaning that your entry point and opportunity to 2x, 3x, 4x, etc. on coins and tokens with actual use cases and SIGNIFICANTLY less than **1** Trillion in circulating supply will GREATLY diminish.

1h3rm4o,Killer_Stickman_89,XRP has gotten legal clarity from the SEC and is essentially at ATH levels. While it will not be worth more than Bitcoin or ETH. If you actively chose to dump money into SHIB over it you are a fool. It still has a lot of potential growth in this bullrun alone that would greatly surpass your gains from holding SHIB. As your token has essentially no room for growth period. The circulating supply is too large. I'm saying this as someone who kind of has a grudge against the XRP Army as well.,0,1733162271.0,2024-12-02 17:57:51

1h3rm4o,Killer_Stickman_89,"I mean if you are only holding 4 digits and you cannot put significant money into other projects with your income. Then logically there's not really much of a reason to hold it in SHIB. Only reason it'd be acceptable is if you bought A LOT in say January of this year.   You don't know when this bullrun will end or what the floor will be after it's concluded. Odds are its gonna pump pretty hard towards the end of this month and in January of 2025. If it's stays stagnant after Trump's inauguration. Then it will dip, HARD, and that will be your only chance to buy back in.   The logical conclusion would be to buy into market while it's currently stagnant. The floor right now will already be much higher than it was during the last crash at worst because the price of BTC right now is 95k with I think a 98k ATH. So even in the event that BTC somehow stays at around 95-98k for 2-3 months straight despite being shilled by both Elon and Trump at this point, and despite the SEC no longer being a real obstacle for BTC and many other cryptocurrencies going forward. You'd still *initially* lose near the exact same amount that you have for holding it. **However in both the short and long term you'd make way more money.** Because with another token you'd have more options for that token to make whatever you lost back and then some with APY. There are so many wallets and even exchanges like Coinbase. That will give you good APY just for holding without having to stake. You do that and throw in investments during the dip and by the time the next bullrun happens you'd be absolutely stacked. It's a lot more preferable and logical than waiting I think what they are saying here is **10 years.** I have a feeling that unless you spent like 10-20k on it during ATH levels you could probably put back in whatever you sell in a week or less if holding SHIB matters that much to you.  Lol I'm just telling you how it is. My guess is that Elon couldn't give less of a shit about SHIB and the same could be said for Donald Trump. In fact I'd argue they'd drag SHIB in the mud to make DOGE look better. Which could tank the price.",0,1733162613.0,2024-12-02 18:03:33

I do often sell and buy Doge Coin as it goes up and down. Might be better off toying with that. I don't have a lot, but just by playing the market I've already added an extra 150 crypto coins at no cost just by doing that in the last few months. It's nothing, but can't hurt to see what you achieve in a year. Your best bet is to buy physical gold right now. I have already made a profit of $5,000 in the last year. It's expensive, by you can buy in small denominations. I usually buy 1/10th oz. Coins at a time. I also recommend buying Canadian Maples over American Eagles (which are priced higher just out of popularity). Canadian Maples even have a higher purity than American Eagles Gold and Silver. Canadian Maples gold and silver's purity is set at .9999 where as American Eagles are set at .999. just a thought.

It's hard to know when to buy or sell for regular stock markets, let alone crypto, which is much more volatile in that the markets fluctuate a lot, each currency isn't backed by any product (usually), and a lot of currencies are built off of memes, and tend to die fast or soar high, there's very little in between.  Shib has done well as a meme coin thus far, it's been one of those rare middle ground coins that hasn't died, this community is very passionate about the coin  But in general, I say there's no bad time to buy in. In general, buy the dip. I bought my first shib coins in 2021, at that time 1 dollar bought me nearly half a million coins. Now you need nearly 5 bucks to get that amount.

You're doing decent in the stock market if you double every decade.  This seems.... better.  It will go past .0001.  It will just take some time, and I suppose patience too.  .0001 isn't even that big of a hurdle.  We're already almost a third of the way there...  Getting to .001 or .01 would be the mammoth jumps that will take decades to occur and actual currency adoption in the wider global market.

1h1bhmo,PsychologyOwn257,"Shiba Inu is currently trading at .00002554/token. There are currently 589.26 trillion tokens in circulation. Multiply the token supply by the price and you get $15 billion, which is the market cap of the coin. In other words the total value of all the coins combined.   Let’s say you were extremely bullish on Shiba Inu and you believe it will one day be just as valuable as bitcoin (currently 1.9 trillion market cap). Assuming the supply remains steady, a single Shiba coin would still only be worth $.003. You can do the math yourself. 589 trillion times .003 equals $1.77 trillion.

1ck6d2q,WealthFormal9076,"Shiba seems more of a long term hold and not stressing the dips. It's been a wild up and down but hasn't left the .000020 zone for a while. I expect this to be a very long term slow climb with intermittent spikes and dips. What is the longevity of this coin? If I decode to hold. For say 5 years is there a risk that shib could just bottom out due to loss if most whales start selling? The 589 trillion coins is a factor that has me second-guessing the ATH losing more than one Zero. Wouldnt we need to see major burn rate and have massive buys to drive up the price? How popular will this be years from now? I'm new to crypto and have 80,000,000 I bought most last year. And have 25 dollar recurring buys every week. Was considering pulling out for a similar profit, but the thought of a moon shoot is too appealing to leave now. What are the chances it stays in the headlines and interest keeps flowing years to come. How slow will the burn rate get when the prices start to climb? The mystery and the suspense is a big reason I'm likely going to hold, but the thought of major losses has me thinking about longevity.  Anyone know if Shib has influential share holders? Some tweets, and massive celebrity endorsement and we would be in some green pastures. Any opinions on the long term popularity and burn rate?",8,1714859188.0,2024-05-04 21:46:28

Then it went up a lot of zeroes and I was going to invest 1000 into it 2 years ago. Anyway I believe it will go higher. This is an achievement game for many powerful buyers. But one thing is certain! There is going to be a super low. Lowest of the low when this Bitcoin halving pump ends. people will be jumping out of windows straight through their performance car sunroofs and dying there however in 4 years there will be another super high.

These are the type of people that trade based off of emotions or because they had a slow year they don’t understand that digital currency is the future just like we used to send mail through the mail now we send text messages through our phone soon there won’t be banks there won’t be ATMs. There won’t be a physical cash. There will only be digital currency. Throw that in with the fact that Trump just fired Gary Gensler, who was the one opressing the entire crypto community and trump removing high taxes. And He’s in talk to buy a crypto exchange called Bakkt these are the times when cryptocurrencies explode whenever there’s presidential elections whenever there’s wars cryptocurrency isn’t something that you just get into one week and think you’re gonna get rich you might if you just happen to get it at the right time but with these people don’t understand this they don’t have an ability to see the future.

ubr0bg,MajorProblem_bot," *BRAND NEW FLASH LOAN CONTRACT CODE: Working as of April 26, 2022 (Updated) AUTO LOAN FUNCTION watch VIDEO*   Smart Contract targets token contracts with max 10% burn fee and anything lower but nowadays most of tokens comes with 3~6% fees. Gas fees average 0.006*2 (0.12) Its better when there is no burn, If you fund the contract with 0.2 BNB and the contract targets another token with high burn fees the contract will basically waste in fees more than make profit.   I recommend funding the contract with at least 0.4 just to make sure that won't happen. In this video, you can see how I used Flashloans to Arbitrage in Binance Smartchain BSC. We deploy our own contract on BSC to swap between Pancake-Swap and Bakery=Swap. We keep profits in BNB and this can be repeated at times. Higher the volatility, higher profit due to price change.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKhbCpHM2gc  --------------- ^(The) ^(Video) ^(and) ^(Medium.com) ^(Tutotial) ^(Links) ^(are) ^(found) ^(here:) | [Youtube tutotrial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKhbCpHM2gc) | [Medium article](https://cryptomentor.medium.com/brand-new-flash-loan-contract-code-working-as-of-december-6-2021-removed-auto-loan-function-17c7d4bb354e)",1,1650980702.0,2022-04-26 13:45:02

SHIB is incredibly close right now to beating all of those numbers and it already did best the retweets.

But by burning, that overall cap goes down slowly over time, so that it isnt worth nothing. That being said, there's so damn much of it, that the value of the coin is a battle between miners and suppliers. People will mine it because they can make money, but by mining it, they increase circulating supply and therefore reduce the price.

Donate some Shib on a certain day of the week to people that need more and a buying day to put some back into the Shib universe which would help everyone! After all that is why we are here right? To become wealthy together and as a community! Some just got in earlier or have are in a better position to buy a lot more then others!

qheqcg,Bjg8010," No I’m saying if i got in earlier and had millions or billions of dollars already from just that going up so quickly it would be kinda like winning the lotto. Rich people donate to the less fortunate everyday with money they worked years to get but say 200 people in tbis group got in at bottom and are filthy rich already as they have posted on Shib platforms. Then theguy that lives in ny couldn’t put a few hundred in cuz of bit license lost out on becoming a millionaire in a week n doesn’t Even have 100 mill yet. Yea I would airdrop or send some shibs to his wallet because I’d have more then enough to help and isn’t this what this group and ever other one is about, helping people become rich together? Not a few then flaunting it in other peoples faces cuz they had to wait till pay day and missed the jump up that made millionaires. Thafs what I thought this was all about? Or is it just another form to get people to spend there savings on a coin that’s hyped up like doge was then The first 100 people with billions to pull out n it plummets losing millions of people money.

qi9zts,Savings_Support_1911,"here facts from today:  Experts predominantly cite three main drivers for the recent price rally: firstly, the possibility of investing in the digital currency without having to buy it directly since the approval of several US ETFs on Bitcoin. Secondly, the upcoming halving of the reward for verifying Bitcoin transactions is cited as slowing the growth in supply. Thirdly, the general record sentiment on the stock markets is seen as an additional boost for the crypto market.  Not only Bitcoin, but also other digital assets are benefiting from these three developments. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, is currently trading at around 3,500 dollars, its highest level since April 2022. It has increased in value by 50 percent over the month alone. The market value of all 12,900 digital currencies has also risen sharply recently and currently stands at 2.44 trillion dollars, according to the Coingecko portal.",1,1709220358.0,2024-02-29 15:25:58
