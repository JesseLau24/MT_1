qi9zts,Ok_View8272,If someone bought 1 million Shiba inu CRYPTOCURRENCY they would control majority of the supply and the price would go well over $1 per Shiba Inu  DUE TO THE TOTAL SUPPLY OF SHIBA INU DROPPING and they would profit trillions of dollars they would gain hundreds of trillions of USD. DOGE SHOULD DO THIS BEFORE SOMEONE ELSE DOSE. If I had 1 million dollars I'd spend it all on Shiba Inu and due to the available amount of Shiba inu that remain i would profit hundreds of trillions of USD,1,1742772051.0,2025-03-23 23:20:51

qi9zts,Savings_Support_1911,"here facts from today:  Experts predominantly cite three main drivers for the recent price rally: firstly, the possibility of investing in the digital currency without having to buy it directly since the approval of several US ETFs on Bitcoin. Secondly, the upcoming halving of the reward for verifying Bitcoin transactions is cited as slowing the growth in supply. Thirdly, the general record sentiment on the stock markets is seen as an additional boost for the crypto market.  Not only Bitcoin, but also other digital assets are benefiting from these three developments. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, is currently trading at around 3,500 dollars, its highest level since April 2022. It has increased in value by 50 percent over the month alone. The market value of all 12,900 digital currencies has also risen sharply recently and currently stands at 2.44 trillion dollars, according to the Coingecko portal.",1,1709220358.0,2024-02-29 15:25:58
