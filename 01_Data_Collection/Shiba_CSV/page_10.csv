1gy6f0m,Canadianretordedape,"What a thrilling and challenging hypothetical scenario! To spearhead a roadmap to get SHIB to $1 within 5-10 years, I‚Äôd implement the following steps:  *Phase 1 (Years 1-2): Building Foundations*  1. Establish a strong governance structure for the SHIB community, including a decentralized decision-making process. 2. Develop a clear roadmap with milestones and key performance indicators (KPIs). 3. Foster partnerships with reputable organizations to enhance credibility. 4. Launch a robust marketing campaign focusing on SHIB‚Äôs unique features and use cases. 5. Develop and implement a token burn mechanism to reduce supply and increase value.  *Phase 2 (Years 2-4): Ecosystem Expansion*  1. Develop and launch a decentralized exchange (DEX) and liquidity pool to enhance trading and liquidity. 2. Create a SHIB-based lending and borrowing platform. 3. Establish a SHIB-themed gaming and NFT ecosystem. 4. Launch a SHIB-powered payment gateway for merchants. 5. Expand the SHIB community through strategic partnerships and outreach programs.  *Phase 3 (Years 4-6): Scaling and Adoption*  1. Develop and implement sharding or layer 2 scaling solutions to enhance transaction capacity. 2. Launch a SHIB-based stablecoin to reduce volatility. 3. Establish partnerships with mainstream businesses for real-world adoption. 4. Develop a comprehensive education and training program for SHIB users. 5. Host annual SHIB conferences and hackathons to foster innovation.  *Phase 4 (Years 6-10): Maturity and Global Recognition*  1. Achieve listing on top-tier exchanges and secure regulatory compliance. 2. Launch a SHIB-based decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. 3. Establish a SHIB-themed venture capital fund for blockchain startups. 4. Host a SHIB-themed global festival to celebrate adoption and community growth. 5. Continuously monitor and adapt to market trends and technological advancements.  Measures to ensure success:  1. Regular progress tracking and community updates. 2. Adaptable governance structure to address emerging challenges. 3. Continuous investment in research and development. 4. Strong community engagement and incentivization programs. 5. Strategic partnerships and collaborations.  Failure is not an option! With a well-structured roadmap, dedicated community, and adaptability, we can achieve the goal of reaching $1 within 5-10 years.

1gy6f0m,Canadianretordedape,"Then asked ‚Äúexpand on how you will accomplish phase 1 point 1l  Phase 1, Point 1: Establish a strong governance structure for the SHIB community, including a decentralized decision-making process.  To accomplish this, I would:  1.1: Conduct a community survey to understand the current governance structure, identify pain points, and gather feedback on desired changes.  1.2: Research and analyze existing governance models in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space, such as DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations), to determine the most suitable framework for SHIB.  1.3: Propose a governance structure that includes:  a) A decentralized decision-making process using a voting system (e.g., token-based voting or delegate-based voting).  b) A council or board comprising representatives elected by the community, responsible for overseeing governance and making strategic decisions.  c) Clear roles and responsibilities for community members, including contributors, moderators, and developers.  d) A transparent and auditable decision-making process, ensuring accountability and trust.  1.4: Develop a governance token (e.g., SHIB-GOV) to enable community members to participate in voting and decision-making processes.  1.5: Implement a decentralized governance platform (e.g., DAOstack, Aragon) to facilitate voting, proposal submission, and decision-making.  1.6: Establish a dispute resolution process to address conflicts and ensure community cohesion.  1.7: Foster a culture of open communication, transparency, and inclusivity, ensuring all community members have a voice and are encouraged to contribute.  1.8: Review and refine the governance structure regularly, incorporating community feedback and adapting to evolving needs.  By following these steps, we can create a robust governance structure that empowers the SHIB community, ensures decentralized decision-making, and sets the foundation for a successful and sustainable ecosystem.",3,1732405644.0,2024-11-23 23:47:24

1gva8iw,BigMacNoOnions,"Well my question would be, what was the price when you put 2,000 in? Did you sell it? Or are you still holding that initial 2,000 in shiba?   I can go to the app, and see what the price was at the end of 2020. Divide 2,000 by the price (I just picked a day at the end of 2020 since you said you bought it at end of 2020) so I'm picking a 0.0000000001 and that would give you around 20,000,000,000,000 coins. If you sold that at mid May 2021 when it was at 0.00001 or mid September at 0.00009 then you would've had you at $200,000,000 or 1,800,000,000 (this is just the peak prices at those time.   Again, I would need more information like what price you bought in at and what price you sold at, if you did sell.   Fractions on fractions makes a huge different if there's a vast different like what is said above. If the margin is small, then obviously it makes no difference.   I bought $250 Doge at 0.0022 and never thought it would go high like it did, and I sold it and got roughly 79,500 before taxes/fees. Fractions do make a difference, especially if you put a lot in to where the gains are massive.",1,1740091285.0,2025-02-20 22:41:25

Each time I made more and more money because every time it was doubled of what I had at that current time. Made over 22k in 4 years after taxes. If you ask me, I think over time that can buy a new car or used for a nice head start in the stock market. Idk that's what I use crypto for, money in crypto holding, but then when it's low I double what I have for predicted hikes and dips.

These kind of numbers, when used on actual stocks with genuine value (revenue, expenses, etc), are determined through a historical analysis of the stocks performance over the past 5 years/60 months. That type of historical analysis is considered one of the weaker forms of financial analysis but is used as a starting point to further analyze market trends, new releases, and industry events that may impact the stock.  When you attempt to use that form of analysis on a speculation based item, such as crypto currency, it loses all value as there is no underlying real value being tracked historically. All there is is speculation, and historical trending does nothing with current public opinion.   Furthermore, again there has been no additional commentary or reasoning for the numbers being listed (provable impactful events, industry trends and their relation to the specific item, etc). At best the 'prediction' is using a financial analysis that doesnt work with the item (crypto currency), meaning that the numbers are meaningless.    So, tldr.
