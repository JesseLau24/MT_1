So step 1 is consider how high the market cap could reasonably be. 20B, 100B, 1T, etc. Then take that number and divide it by the number of coins in circulation to see what the price could reasonably reach.   Simple answer, anyweheee in the ballpark of 0.1 to 0.0001 is best described as impossible to next to impossible. For each 0 for the coin to lose its market cap would need to increase 10 fold and or 90% of the coins would need to be burned.",4,1731886399.0,2024-11-17 23:33:19

1gt8hdn,Argus24601,"Realistically, maybe drop another couple of zeros, $0.001 tops. If SHIB had the market cap of BTC today, the price would be $0.002997. That's about 113X from where it is right now. So, as crypto adoption increases, and if they burn enough SHIB, yeah, maybe it could get to  $0.0005, by 2030 or longer, but I'm not sure how likely that is. If you 10X from here in the next few years, I'd consider that a big win, if you want to hold onto it until retirement age (if it even survives it that long) then maybe you'll 50X to around $0.0012. Kind of the way google and apple stockholders who bought in 2001 still have their shares.  If you thought you'd strike it big from buying $500 of SHIB anytime after it was listed on major CEX's, it ain't gonna happen. You needed to buy within a month of launch to make moves like that, back when it had 10 zeros after the decimal. But turning $500 into $30K over 25 years, sure, it's possible. It's the 11th most popular coin in the world right now, so it has a decent chance of surviving. For SHIB, it's going to be about holding long term.",10,1731875305.0,2024-11-17 20:28:25
