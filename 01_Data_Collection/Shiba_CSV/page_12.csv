1glvjne,cobrayouth,"Here is the problem with predictions. People that say it won't happen base their opinion on what has happened. 95% of the time they will be correct. However, 5% of the time the owners can make some sort of drastic change that makes the price go up. Stocks are a great example. 1cent will probably never happen but something could change that makes it shoot up. Who knows as long as the owners keep working for it.",0,1731013067.0,2024-11-07 20:57:47
