1fwk1y9,Confident_Camera_762,Can’t truly know. And 99.99% of people saying shib to the moon have no logic or insight to what they’re saying.,3,1728135552.0,2024-10-05 13:39:12

1fwk1y9,beetlebadascan05,"If by moon you mean .000024, it's about a 6/8 month wait. Then she'll have to land and refuel around .000013. But then it'll be BACK TO THE MOON BABY at .000024ish then she'll have to land and refuel.   you see there's money to be made with shib. But it's not by hodl if you catch my drift.   People need to adjust their perception of where the moon is.   I have 2 accounts with 250 mil tokens each   One I hold just in case. One I trade with the roller coaster ride. The one I hold on paper, I'm currently up 1,200.00  The one I trade I've made 14k over the last 3 years.",2,1728205471.0,2024-10-06 09:04:31

1fwk1y9,HotCourt6842,"the supply is finite. and constantly reducing. if youre referring to utility suggesting long term global dominance, then i agree, although terms of utility used as in a contextual sense relating to the actual use-case of the coin then id disagree with you. because the coin has just as much utility as any other coin, in fact its listed in multiple online casinos and implemented into multiple transaction networks. shib is used for nfts, gaming, donations, merchants and retail, and more. as you say it “just follows bitcoin” i don’t know if youre referring to general market dynamics or if you’re incorrectly inferring that shib coin goes up the same percent as bitcoin and down accordingly, when in fact actually ironically shib outpaces bitcoin almost every time in terms of gains.",0,1728199593.0,2024-10-06 07:26:33
