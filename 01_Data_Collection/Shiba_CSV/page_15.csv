1fpx5j9,444SOULS,What the heck no invest now as much as possible then when it hits a dollar SELL,1,1727378634.0,2024-09-26 19:23:54
1fpx5j9,[deleted],[deleted],1,1727501319.0,2024-09-28 05:28:39
1fpx5j9,444SOULS,Thereâ€™s enough tokens to burn for it to eventually get there. Be patient and be supportive,2,1727501691.0,2024-09-28 05:34:51
1fpx5j9,[deleted],[deleted],1,1727504183.0,2024-09-28 06:16:23
1fpx5j9,444SOULS,This is true. But maybe 0.05 is more realistic. Itâ€™s still astronomically unlikely but it could get there eventually,1,1727504538.0,2024-09-28 06:22:18
1fpx5j9,Signal-Fish8538,It was up then down a while now itâ€™s going back up,2,1727364958.0,2024-09-26 15:35:58
1fpx5j9,CuliacIsland,"I would recommend investing in something that has a lower MC. Like K9, Bone or Roaring Kitty on ETH. Your chance to make a bigger return could be much higher in this bullrun because of the low MC and potential for 100x or higher",2,1727367786.0,2024-09-26 16:23:06

1fpx5j9,Negative_Hedgehog969,You should invest in www.Gottitoken.io,1,1727544037.0,2024-09-28 17:20:37
1fpx5j9,[deleted],I personally never invest when its on a run. Too risky. Buy low sell high. Don't buy high and sell low. So many shib holders do this wrong.,1,1727435613.0,2024-09-27 11:13:33

1fpx5j9,[deleted],Checks shib price...Yeah like I said I don't buy on a run. 10% 20% 34% up is a horrible time to buy into anything.Â  No idea what your on about. I imagine your 80% down after fomo in at 150% up buy in. You seem bitter.   Hope you get the help you need.,1,1727666783.0,2024-09-30 03:26:23

1fpx5j9,i_eat_babies__,"This is the way. I put $5.00 into SHIB just to keep it on the forefront of my portfolio and keep track of it (because I'm also managing options, my stocks, my index funds, etc. so I like to have it where I can see it).   Once I saw shib go up 40% this week, I immediately thought ""okay, thats definitely a buy on the next crypto winter"".
