1f5pe80,HM3-LPO,If we drop below .000010--I'm buying another 100 million SHIB. Any ideas how low this correction may go? Let me know!,2,1725231350.0,2024-09-01 22:55:50

1f5pe80,HM3-LPO,"I hope you're feeling much better today. You know my typical remarks are to the naysayers. I see opportunity with the dips/corrections (obviously) and I believe that SHIB potentially has a very promising future; so, I keep advocating for what I believe. Thanks for the support you have given me to block trolls and keep the faith. I hope you are back to feeling 100% better soon!",2,1725284086.0,2024-09-02 13:34:46
1f5pe80,NihilistHUGZ,I rolled over last night and got sick. I pulled up my phone when i laid back down and seen 0.00001321 and bought 5 million SHIB to make myself feel better. I love large dips too!,2,1725284453.0,2024-09-02 13:40:53
1f5pe80,HM3-LPO,"I know you do! My average cost is .0000130: so, if it dips below that, then I will definitely buy more. If we only had a crystal ball to let us know how low it could go. I would buy a lot more on a major dip for sure.",1,1725284847.0,2024-09-02 13:47:27
1f5pe80,NihilistHUGZ,I feel 100% different but still feeling weak. I finished working outside around 430iah abd by 530 i was fubar. My pregnant sister saved me with her nausea medicine and I think I am going to roll with it today since the sickness part is over. Heat messes me up after getting heat sickness in a paintsuit doing drywall work for ny Uncle in my mid 20's. Heat messes me up quick ever since. Im a tough old bird though,2,1725284652.0,2024-09-02 13:44:12
1f5pe80,HM3-LPO,I knew you were a young man with a young family but heatstroke/sickness is serious at any age. I was a Hospital Corpsman in the Navy for eight years and saw plenty of it. When I was young I hung drywall for a contractor and that is some very labor intensive work (especially in a hot environment). Take it easy today boss. I don't need to tell you to get rest and plenty of liquids. Happy Labor Day to you!,2,1725285301.0,2024-09-02 13:55:01
1f5pe80,NihilistHUGZ,"Yeah I'm only 34 and it tears me up quick. I couldn't believe my basic yardwork, weedeat and mow, got me so good. I was laid in the bottom of my shower just sick as a dog when it hit me. I guess I had stayed hydrated, but had so much on my mind from my granny passing that I forgot to eat. Thank you for the kind words and my wife is home with me and she is mum'ing me good. Happy Labor Day!",2,1725293484.0,2024-09-02 16:11:24
