1eo41pm,NihilistHUGZ,I can confidently say yes. It is not going away for many many years. Shiba Inu is dug in deep and has weathered quite a bit already. It deserves confidence at this point. Technically speaking based on the charts I have indicators going off like crazy saying movement is coming. I have an ongoing project that will take me some time looking forwars. I hope to map the cycles and have a full breakdown. For now it is slow but we turned a corner 2 days ago and the long-term is looking ecer better. I have SHIB structured as short and long. My long I plan on keeping and selling at points from the years 2030-2040. Then I factored in my daughter and when my day comes her and my wife will be set.,2,1723256301.0,2024-08-10 02:18:21
