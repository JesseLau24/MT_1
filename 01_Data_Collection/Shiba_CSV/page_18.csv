It was reported that if it happens it will be a true flashspike. Set a limit if you can so you can rest easy. It would be awesome to watch it drop back down and get the same amount at half price. The article I read did not give a projected time of day but was very specific that it would happen on August 3rd. I'm skeptical yet if it were going to happen then it would be on a Saturday. My limit sell is conservative because I own 50 million @ .000013. The analysts projected .000032! I set it low for FOMO.",1,1722655708.0,2024-08-03 03:28:28

1eglteq,NihilistHUGZ,"I share your sentiment. Crypto is volatile, and the quick fluctuations can be hard to predict when I just use my charts. I began digging into possibilities and I think a huge factor is greed. There are several coins in presale which make people feel they could have the ‚ÄòLambo‚Äô as soon as they go live. After GameStop, I started noticing short squeezes everywhere. Then I came to crypto, and Shiba Inu in particular, and it was more than I had ever expected. Essentially, large whale accounts and their interests pump up these new cryptos and everyone buys in. Then they dump on all of them and move to the next. Wash, rinse, repeat.  I discovered the United States Government is a huge whale of Shiba Inu. I found that to be the stability I couldn‚Äôt find in other cryptos. If it wasn‚Äôt for the Shib Army, the whales would have hijacked SHIB. Our organic growth and interest is what keeps us afloat. The clickbait ads seem to be funded by someone with the interest to scare Shiba Inu investors, but the devs and the overall verifiable goals they accomplish tell the truth of our direction. Most investors are not seasoned traders that know what is going on, and they get scared when they think they are going to lose money they can‚Äôt afford to lose. That‚Äôs another sign of someone who should ‚Äòset it and forget it.‚Äô  Gamestop‚Äôn Whales Targeted Clickbait Ads Disparaging members in the overall community",1,1722446694.0,2024-07-31 17:24:54

The 1% token burn is a good idea but the good idea is really that we should show solidarity as a community behind any idea one of our own has.

1ed4ats,Cold-Positive-818,You get started from that comment. She stated auto burns would be in last year. They apparently had it in puppy net in January and still no word. If we are relying on this team doing a burn when they feel like it and only burning what they feel like then this is just more lies. They still are sitting on bone from shibarium from when it was hitting some inflated numbers when it launched. Look at how much it's being used now compared to back then.,2,1722531481.0,2024-08-01 16:58:01
1ed4ats,NihilistHUGZ,I believe started as in we are finally rolling somewhere. Lucie gave transparent updates about the actual implementation of burns. After the puppynet transitioned to the Sepolia network the burns became a guarantee. Up until that point they were manual burns. The new technologies we keep advancing into come layered with burn mechanisms. After Mainnet release we had like 8 billion tokens burned. The advancements of the ecosystem are the auto burns we were waiting for. Between Layer 3 and ShibaSwap 2 we should start to see the other layers of our ecosystem start increasing their ability for burns. Bone had to be renounced and now its implementation is seen with Weex. Bone surged double digits after Shibaswap was integrated.,1,1722533007.0,2024-08-01 17:23:27
1ed4ats,Cold-Positive-818,"No she didn't. Never gave proper dates and still hasn't. She stated manual burns from shibarium could be initiated by anyone post the 25000 mark. They rolled back on that. She is the worst marketing lead I every seen. She spins more opium than anyone and no one disagree or question without being shamed or slated. She also said we could be burning 5 trillion a month. Pure mule that will never happen after two cuts to the fees that shibarium is supposed to accurate. There is no transparency with this team. No measurable goals and no communication on key milestones.they are using shib to fill their boots with bone,lease, stupid NFTs and the like.",2,1722540762.0,2024-08-01 19:32:42
1ed4ats,NihilistHUGZ,"Oh, I don‚Äôt agree with Lucie if you‚Äôre getting that impression. In fact, I got myself banned by her X account earlier for going to bat for this community.

For now, I concede that you are right about the definitive tone she has presented, but I look at the things that are verifiable, and it feels like there is more than we all know, whether good or bad, we all deserve to know.

1ebw1vu,cryptonija,"I find it fascinating how SHIB has been gaining so much attention lately. It's amazing to see how quickly the cryptocurrency market can shift and evolve. I'm curious to hear everyone's thoughts on where they see SHIB heading in the near future. Do you think it will continue to rise, or are we due for a correction soon? Let's discuss!",1,1721934048.0,2024-07-25 19:00:48
1ebw1vu,NihilistHUGZ,"I believe we are moving towards a stable market, partly due to the increasing political attention that cryptocurrencies are receiving, which means that crypto investors are now considered a significant voting demographic. This is the start of wider recognition and integration, potentially helping the industry growth.  I anticipate Congressional investigations will look at the future of cryptocurrency, particularly targeting the ‚Äòwhales‚Äô who have significantly influenced the market. The crypto movement began organically, but as more money flowed in and regulatory oversight remained minimal, it attracted scepticism. Consequently, new investors, unfamiliar with the differences of cryptocurrencies from traditional stocks, are at risk of financial losses.  Our slice of the market is more secure than the NEW ‚Äòmeme coins,‚Äô which are susceptible to rapid inflation and deflation. We call this ‚Äòpump and dump‚Äô schemes. We have transcended the meme status and matured. A fact that many are yet to be recognize. They underestimate the resilience of the SHIBArmy.  PS not all whales are bad.

1eaabil,NihilistHUGZ,"I am nerding so hard. I agree 100%. I love the numbers and the correlation to real world events. My hobby is tracking stocks, but with crypto it is a 24/7 market. I have transitioned 73% of my portfolio to SHIB this year, because I have enjoyed tracking it more than any other. The shear volume is fascinating. I will be posting a daily analysis so I look forward to knowing you might be stopping in to read them.  An interesting note about crypto analytics is now is the time for method discovery like a puzzle fresh from the box. Over time I will put the puzzle together and see greater than 85% probability. Analysis for crypto is still in infancy imo. Stock and options are becoming slow and boring. That market already runs off a highly efficient model that makes it  hard to wait to get to play only between the times the extended market hours are open. 24/7 access to my hobby with SHIB!",1,1721776227.0,2024-07-23 23:10:27

I'm only confident in SHIB at this point for my own cash investments. All my years of stock analysis will need a paradigm adjustment due to 24/7 trading essentially a penny stock of a crypto.

1e9gcpx,NihilistHUGZ,Mid Day Update: It turned 'wait and see' fast today.

1e9gcpx,NihilistHUGZ,I've 64.73mill on my Robinhood account so I understand your range. I'll try that keep that in mind in the future when i do projections. It will be easy for me to track because that account is so close to your total so under 100k and over 100k influences... Check and check!,1,1721670866.0,2024-07-22 17:54:26
1e9gcpx,NihilistHUGZ,New Update based on changes in my methodologies. A little more insight for our spectrum of investors.    I have analyzed the ADX for short-term and long-term. So let me cut to it. All of our other indicators show us that we are at a wait and see but they may not have responded to the ADX showing a strong trend coming. We are at ADX 3 day 26.91 and ADX 14 day 28.02. These adx values show that a strong trend is coming. It is in my opinion that indicators are in place that we should prepare for potential volatility and significant price movements. I say that because I have applied some of my best work here even theoretical and we have rose past key indicators. Fibonacci 61.8% at 0.000017 and it even struggled just like we should have on our way to 100% in the sequence. Elliott wave is right there in 3-5 phase. I suspect 4 which is on its way to Phase 5. A high ADX over a longer period would indicate a strong trend pressure. I am not sure of a timeline definitively but with all these indicators I think we are all about to see our investment make a move.   EOD projection holds SAME with potential to test upper Bollinger support of 0.000018 being only slight immediate change suspected. Any bearish indicators that are strong and we could see our 0.000017 support tested again.,1,1721683093.0,2024-07-22 21:18:13
