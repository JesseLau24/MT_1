1e8smf2,EvitiSempai,What should I buy?,3,1721653946.0,2024-07-22 13:12:26
1e8smf2,OldschoolChebys,BUY THE DIPS OF CRYPTO. BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW BTC WILL RALLEY IF TRUMP IS ELECTED. REST WILL FOLLOW.,9,1721587169.0,2024-07-21 18:39:29
1e8smf2,NihilistHUGZ,When i posted it was a heck of a dip,5,1721587456.0,2024-07-21 18:44:16
1e8smf2,NihilistHUGZ,You do have a point and people shouldn't down vote. It is investor sentiment and it influences our investments equally. We should have open dialogues to express the fact of the sentiments. Investors are more confident under Trump and that is highly documented. The point of this post was to draw attention to a decisive influence for our investments. I have highlighted in other posts on Reddit communities the relationship of Bitcoin with SHIB and in February we became highly intertwined. Please be open minded to the sentiments and think through a spectrum of investment potential. Buy dips and i posted at the lowest I seen. They coincided so I posted. Thank you OldSchool for your comment!,2,1721591235.0,2024-07-21 19:47:15

1e8smf2,Cunt2113,Which is the issue. Nobody else on the ticket has the majority so votes will be split heavily an since they'll be split none of them will touch trumps numbers. So they'll lose just on having no real runner Nobody unanimously backs. Dem votes are too divided now without Biden unfortunately.  An peoplw aren't smart enough to go 3rd party either.,2,1721597720.0,2024-07-21 21:35:20

1e8smf2,NihilistHUGZ,No that is way beyond my intent. I will say it plain. I am the messenger bringing a latest development to investors. I am not advocating any candidates. This is to draw attention to sentiment buying. I posted the moment i seen the letter and it was coincidentally the same time SHIB dropped. Then as the news quickly spread the price rose. It was an investment opportunity to see a 0.00000137 increase in per share price and show the price will inevitably be affected by this news. Based on the recent hack and any news where SHIB is influenced is worthy for investment consideration. I've got options calls on other stock I could suggest based on latest news sentiment if you want that instead.,1,1721596772.0,2024-07-21 21:19:32

1e8smf2,NihilistHUGZ,The fact of overcame in this instance is in my opinion based by the support price as an indication of 'Holding' or 'Failing'. Based on the SHIB support price vs. current price SHIB did not 'Fail'  Most decentralized assets affected directly or indirectly by these instances held their investment potential when weighed against support prices and the overall greater influence of Bitcoin in relation to investor sentiment was influenced by these instances.,1,1721592969.0,2024-07-21 20:16:09

Don't let your emotions get the better of you (i.e stress out and panic sell, or feed into hype when it goes up and buy at a high point). Remember that crypto is volatile which means it is prone to significant changes that can be both increases and decreases. don't invest money that you can't afford to lose or that you need back soon. hopefully that covers some of what you don't have a clue about üòÜ",6,1720277260.0,2024-07-06 14:47:40

Also, something to know is that most crypto follows bitcoin. So if bitcoin is dropping, then most other crypto is going to drop and vice versa when it starts going up, most other crypto will start going up. so if you're invested in something and it starts dropping a lot, take a look at bitcoin and that will tell you a lot.
