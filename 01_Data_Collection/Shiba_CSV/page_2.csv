1ilkqqi,trobits,"Burning simply means permanently removing coins from circulation; the coins are lost forever. It is a mechanism often employed to reduce the circulating supply of a particular coin to boost the price. For example, Shibarium uses a portion of the trading fees to buy back SHIB and burn. Think of it like stock buyback in traditional finance. The difference is that with stock buyback, the company can actually sell those stocks later. However, with crypto burning, the process is irreversible.",2,1739485523.0,2025-02-13 22:25:23

1if6tgv,YoOow28,"So they have to burn trillions and throw away their investments while no one else has to burn?   ""Let me throw away 1000's of dollars so people who only invested a couple 100 or a couple 1000 can be rich""   I seriously don't understand how people still think this is a real possibility. The only way to make this happen is if they get a reward in the form of some other coin related to shib (like Bone was in the past) that way their investment isn't thrown into the bin but is actually worth something.   Right now people who have trillions keep making tons of money by selling on high prices, buying in on low prices.. all the normal people keep on failling to realise that and make the whales even more money.  This coin is dead and has been dead for the last 2 years",2,1738435771.0,2025-02-01 18:49:31
1if6tgv,bettiewilde," I get the skepticism, but the reality is SHIB‚Äôs supply is the biggest barrier to price growth. No one is asking people to burn trillions alone‚Äîit‚Äôs about collective action. If every holder burns their excess SHIB, we all benefit from a higher price per token over time.  That said, burns need incentives to be truly effective. That‚Äôs why projects like Shibarium and reward-based burns are so important. Instead of just burning for the sake of it, imagine if SHIB burns were linked to real utility‚Äîstaking rewards, exclusive access, or other token perks.  And let‚Äôs be real: SHIB isn‚Äôt dead. With ongoing developments in Shibarium, metaverse integrations, and DeFi expansion, the project still has major growth potential. The whales win because they play the long game‚Äîso why shouldn‚Äôt the SHIB Army do the same? üöÄüî•",4,1738450059.0,2025-02-01 22:47:39
