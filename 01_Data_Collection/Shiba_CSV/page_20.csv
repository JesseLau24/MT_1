1duunvo,dontttttknow,"Yes, i removed them from circulation. This decree the amount of coins that are able to be traded, there for making them a bit more valuable. 6 Million is absolutely nothing compared to what needs to be burnt but every little bit helps",2,1720062293.0,2024-07-04 03:04:53

1duunvo,dontttttknow,"Yes! This unfortunately Will take a little while but will happen. I have seen this coin since it was first sold on coinbase - (coincloud digital atm) i dont know if it's the same, but coin cloud went bankrupt is all i know. I have destroyed hundreds of millions over the last few years. I was fortunate enough to buy it before it was easily accessible. I cant remember how much i had gotten but $75 etheirum swapped to shiba at that price got me quite a lot of them. I honestly can't remember. I do remember buying the coin, saying "" this will take a while ill just forget about it and check on it every week"" a week later i opened the wallet and nearly died. I saw the spike and couldn't believe that i was technically a multi-million air for the entire time i was not looking at the app. I did transfer a large amount of coins to random wallets i found on shibburn. I looked at my girlfriend at the time and said ""ha ha i just sent x amount of coins to a bunch of random wallets. I want to freak them out"" ""IDGAF, I'm mad at you for even buying it in the first place. Im done rolling, lets smoke""  that had beyond pissed me off and is why i remember that event so well, other than that, she had gotten me extremely high every night for 2 years straight. That is why I can't fully remember what happened but i broke the phone i was using at the time and couldn't get back into the wallet. I gave up on it for a year or 2 came back,  and lost both of my wallets i had made. thankfully i burnt 85%-95% of them before losing said wallets. I recently got ahold of the last last last one i made. I had 37 million in my wallet. I bought more coins then looked at the Shiba burn rate and said ""someone has got to do something about this"" then proceeded to burn i believe close to 50 million coins over 2 days. A 3rd of what the community event had burnt the week prior.",4,1720067971.0,2024-07-04 04:39:31

Shib isn't unique, it just trends with bitcoin. Some said this year was gonna shock many people. What I've learned is that we're all amateurs faking it til we making.

Dogecoin is going to continue to go up along with Shiba, I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs gonna be the alt season we had seen 5 years ago. I don‚Äôt see some 10,000% increase coming. But $1 or $2 dogecoin is very possible. Again your opinion is strong and I respect it but I disagree with it heavily.

I doubt anyone and I mean anyone would believe you if you said Facebook ( meta ) would go from $90 coming off a massive drop from ~$300 and then take back off and within 2 years would be above $500.
