1d9npsm,[deleted],Me. I got greedy last time it spiked. I sold at the right time and made out pretty good but it kept going up I thought I could make a few extra easy dollars. Picked about the worst time to buy more now I have a big red blotch in my portfolio. Im thankful it coulda been a lot worse than it is. But right now I have a steady reminder not to get greedy,7,1717695747.0,2024-06-06 17:42:27

I did some self research via google (probably worse thing I could have done) and landed on Robinhood. Mathematically Shib just seemed too much of an upside for growth potential so I started investing with Robinhood. Where I live in MS I have come across hardly anybody that knows anything about crypto or wallets or any of it.  It just all seems foreign to me. I just don‚Äôt want to miss out on cashing out when the time comes because of something not working or me not knowing what to do. Or worse, lose my money I do have invested.

I guess there are people out there that have time to make up something up for a post but I am not one.

I‚Äôm a simpleton from Mississippi and I‚Äôm off social media except for a very rare FB log in once a quarter (I literally got on this because of Shib).   It‚Äôs just a hard concept to understand for me because there‚Äôs nothing tangible. I can‚Äôt go to town to the crypto bank and make a deposit or withdrawal face to face. So that makes me paranoid that I‚Äôve put in a little over a $1000 that is just floating out there in La la land that I‚Äôll never get back. Or even worse, the arbitrary fake thing I purchased actually becomes much more valuable and I can‚Äôt cash in on that.   I obviously took a gamble on this (yes I know, don‚Äôt put up more than you can afford to lose, I haven‚Äôt).
