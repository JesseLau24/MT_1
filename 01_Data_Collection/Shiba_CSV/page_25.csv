1cxldfl,[deleted],"I and the mass majority of the American population agree with your statement. But you have to understand there is bias information on each side of the political news spectrum. Reddit, when it comes to American politics is heavily far left. They will get all information solely based off a headline and a little more off sources that are left wing bias. So if anything you should expect most users on this website to be heavily propagandized. If you just asked a normal person off the internet how they are doing in bidens economy they are more often then not going to side with trump and say biden is doing a horrible job which is accurate. But if you expect that logic on Reddit you are gravely mistaken. You will most likely find people with trump derangement syndrome that will find any way to gas light you into blaming trump for bidens failures. At the end of the day if you hear people blaming trump for todays problems then you have to realize Biden should be able to do something to make it better and take accountability.

That does too much irresponsible spending with bloated bills having unnecessary things that aren‚Äôt helping the economy and contradicting the purpose of the spending. Also democrats control most if not all of big tech so they censor opposition (republicans) as much as they can while not properly fact checking liberal sources. Also the democrat party is my body my choice unless it‚Äôs an experimental shot that has made revelations of causing all the harm people were previously outspoken about. Democrats cling on the false premise that they are the lesser of 2 evils and would rather vote out of spite instead of logic, prime example. A geriatric dementia patient that needs cognitive stimulants to read off a teleprompter is our president just because people eat up all the propaganda about trump.
