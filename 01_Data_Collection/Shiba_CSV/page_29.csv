1cka03f,big_gains_only,I laugh at people who post this ridiculousness. He sells for a small profit and then buys back in at a higher price because of FOMO and then claims he isn't selling until it hits 1 penny. He will sell as soon as it hits .00005 and will try to buy back in at a higher price again. Who is he fooling?,7,1714871950.0,2024-05-05 01:19:10

Then i shilled about that because i think it is a good thing to be that early but dyor if u are interested. In my opinion Kendu will dominate the meme game. Just look at the community, u will see posts from us until next year when kendu is at billion mc. Shytoshi from shib is also in the kendu game and has never invested in other shitcoins but in kendu. He hasnt shilled yet but he is also involved and the devs are also near to shiba. We just want u to do your research and u will see that it goes big. We dont shill to get our bags dumped.

1ck6d2q,WealthFormal9076,"Shiba seems more of a long term hold and not stressing the dips. It's been a wild up and down but hasn't left the .000020 zone for a while. I expect this to be a very long term slow climb with intermittent spikes and dips. What is the longevity of this coin? If I decode to hold. For say 5 years is there a risk that shib could just bottom out due to loss if most whales start selling? The 589 trillion coins is a factor that has me second-guessing the ATH losing more than one Zero. Wouldnt we need to see major burn rate and have massive buys to drive up the price? How popular will this be years from now? I'm new to crypto and have 80,000,000 I bought most last year. And have 25 dollar recurring buys every week. Was considering pulling out for a similar profit, but the thought of a moon shoot is too appealing to leave now. What are the chances it stays in the headlines and interest keeps flowing years to come. How slow will the burn rate get when the prices start to climb? The mystery and the suspense is a big reason I'm likely going to hold, but the thought of major losses has me thinking about longevity.  Anyone know if Shib has influential share holders? Some tweets, and massive celebrity endorsement and we would be in some green pastures. Any opinions on the long term popularity and burn rate?",8,1714859188.0,2024-05-04 21:46:28

Gas fees average 0.006*2 (0.12) Its better when there is no burn, If you fund the contract with 0.2 BNB and the contract targets another token with high burn fees the contract will basically waste in fees more than make profit.

SHIB is incredibly close right now to beating all of those numbers and it already did best the retweets. If enough people go over to his Twitter page and vote, perhaps the next big article written is how much more people want SHIB for AMC payments rather than Dogecoin.

qheqcg,Bjg8010,Lol well if you find a way let me know! I have seen people giving like 1000 shibs to people that upvoted them or something. Guess it just takes a person that‚Äôs already rich to give back to the community and share the wealth! I bet there‚Äôs a lot on this page that are in the position to give to the little guys and ladies to change their lives too ! Or anyone with over 50 million to donate to the late comers ! Shit if I didn‚Äôt live in ny I‚Äôd be one of them and I‚Äôd do it just cuz I could!,3,1635406910.0,2021-10-28 07:41:50

qheqcg,Bjg8010,For anyone feeling generous!! Actually we should pick a giving day . Donate some Shib on a certain day of the week to people that need more and a buying day to put some back into the Shib universe which would help everyone! After all that is why we are here right? To become wealthy together and as a community! Some just got in earlier or have are in a better position to buy a lot more then others! Like when I see a post of someone that already has 20 million dollars and I‚Äôm on the side thinkin I wish I had 20 thousand dollars! Just a thought!

qheqcg,Bjg8010," No I‚Äôm saying if i got in earlier and had millions or billions of dollars already from just that going up so quickly it would be kinda like winning the lotto. Rich people donate to the less fortunate everyday with money they worked years to get but say 200 people in tbis group got in at bottom and are filthy rich already as they have posted on Shib platforms. Then theguy that lives in ny couldn‚Äôt put a few hundred in cuz of bit license lost out on becoming a millionaire in a week n doesn‚Äôt Even have 100 mill yet. Yea I would airdrop or send some shibs to his wallet because I‚Äôd have more then enough to help and isn‚Äôt this what this group and ever other one is about, helping people become rich together? Not a few then flaunting it in other peoples faces cuz they had to wait till pay day and missed the jump up that made millionaires. Thafs what I thought this was all about? Or is it just another form to get people to spend there savings on a coin that‚Äôs hyped up like doge was then The first 100 people with billions to pull out n it plummets losing millions of people money. We are trying not to have the mentality of Wall Street and give everyone here a chance to change their life. I wouldn‚Äôt hasitat to throw a dog a bone if I had a pile of them ! That‚Äôs just me.
