1i7p5kz,JDizzytwenty10,I keep seeing this trobits thing. Can someone tell me how it works and is it legit,3,1737603776.0,2025-01-23 03:42:56
1i7p5kz,trobits,"Very good question. The short version of the answer is: Trobits is a crypto website that uses money from advertisements to buy and burn SHIB $ LUNC  The detailed answer is:  We, SHIB &amp; LUNC holders want to see the price go up and even hit the mythical $1. The truth of the matter is that with the current supply, the $1 is simply impossible. That would be more money than the whole world!  However, if the current total supply (trillions and trillions of coins) is drastically reduced (to billions), then the $1 dream becomes a possibility. Burning SHIB &amp; LUNC is nothing new. Binance burns about 1billion LUNC every month. Shibarium was actually built to burn SHIB. The Terra Luna Classic community has passed several ‚ÄúTax2Burn‚Äù propositions. The problem is that these proposals(Binance,Shibarium etc) rely on people spending money in order for them to have the money they need to burn the coins. For example, Binance charges roughly 0.1% - 0.5% fee when you buy or sell LUNC on their platform. They use about half of that to burn LUNC. Same thing with Shibarium; they charge for every transaction on the platform and a very small fraction is used for burning SHIB. This means we (the community) have to spend billions of dollars every month to buy and sell the coins on those platforms. That‚Äôs the problem!  At Trobits, we came up with a simple idea. What if we can get the community to participate in the burns by contributing time instead of money. That is why we built a platform to provide general crypto info, price quotes, news etc. As the community uses the platform (to do what they already do on other platforms), we generate money through ads and use that to burn the coins.   Now, for this to work, we need some key elements: 1. Traffic: For us to generate any substantial amount,we need heavy traffic to the platform. Luckily, it is estimated that there are about 1.5 million SHIB holders and 5 million LUNC holders. If we have 1 million people visiting the website every day, we would be burning trillions of SHIB and billions of LUNC every month! Just to put things into perspective, CoinMarketCap has over 10 million page views per day!  2, Transparency: If someone tells you they are going to do something, it‚Äôs ok to have doubts. At Trobits, we don‚Äôt tell you what we do. We show you! The burn addresses for SHIB &amp; LUNC are general knowledge. You can simply Google it. We give you the transaction reference for verification. Thank God, nothing is hidden in this open ledger called the Blockchain. We challenge anyone in the whole wide world to check it out and tell us if we did not burn the coins as shown! We will burn every single day and display the information on the website. We want people to come every day to verify!  3. Time: We all want to be millionaires today. Unfortunately, even with aggressive burns, this will take some time. Maybe 5 years to get to $1 if we all get involved. If you burn 100 billion LUNC or 1 trillion SHIB, that will be less than 0.01% of what is out there. We need time in order to burn a significant amount. Don‚Äôt expect price to jump immediately. Time is very important.  This is a long answer but one last thing. Just to be clear: At Trobits we are not doing this simply for the love of the community. We love you guys but let‚Äôs be real. We own these coins individually. If SHIB &amp; LUNC should get to $1, we would be multi millionaires. That is why we have spent money to build the platform and obtain a patent ( oh, yes, we have a patent). We have a vested interest in this project.   Check it out. Run the numbers.  Do the math. If you think there‚Äôs something we should be doing, we would love to hear from you!  Welcome to Trobits, where we earn to burn (www.trobits.com)",3,1737631276.0,2025-01-23 11:21:16

1i7p5kz,trobits,"The key is visits. However, the account number of accounts is important for leverage. An advertiser might pay $1 for 1000 impressions if the community is 1,000 members.

1i7p5kz,LrdJester,"What about looking to create a mobile game like puzzles and survival or something of the like where there are a lot of people that use the in-game advancements by spending actual money. However instead of using actual currency, Fiat currency, use shib. I know in puzzles and survival there are people that spend thousands of dollars a month. Not only with this increase the traffic of shib purchases because people would obviously have to buy shib to be able to spend it in the game but allowing that money being spent to finance the ship coming in that could then be turned around and burned will also increase the price.",1,1737669274.0,2025-01-23 21:54:34
1i7p5kz,trobits,"Interesting idea. We already have plans to add games in the next upgrade. However,the plan is to have the games completely free.

1i7p5kz,LrdJester,I understand entirely. I'm not even necessarily saying it should be on the trobits site. Perhaps a partnership of some type with an existing game manufacturer or developer.
