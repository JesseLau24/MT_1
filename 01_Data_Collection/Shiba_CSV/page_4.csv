1htwf97,trobits,"It will depend on ad revenue, which depends on website traffic. With little traffic, burn rate will be very low, which will take a very, very long time to get to $1.  However, with good traffic, we can generate tens of thousands of dollars daily. This will lead to millions or billions of tokens burned daily.  All this information is displayed on [trobits.com](http://trobits.com) daily, with proof of burn.  Google generated over $237 billion in 2023 from ads alone! They obviously have the largest traffic worldwide. We are not in any illusion that we will have anything even remotely close to this amount. However, we can generate a substantial amount to burn tokens and have a meaningful impact on the price.   The $1 dream is definitely a reality; simply needs a strong community participation.

1hkur8k,Twitchfresse,Bro i will take a Minute to explain something to you.  Shiba token has no real usecase ... give me one example ?  You guys are falling for the same trap ... thinking a few Million Tokens will make you rich when its all just a pile of worthless dust.  You guys love to have both hands full of Sand instead of one Gold Nugget.  After shib there were a lot of meme tokens that outperformed shib like pepe ... and you know what? After pepe there will be the next one and the next one ... but all what is left behind is dead.  If you invest in shib today you clearly have lacking knowledge about how crypto and the market works.  And im not writing this to piss you off ... i was like you a few years ago.  Having exposure to the market through tokens like this is suicide ...,1,1735400537.0,2024-12-28 15:42:17
