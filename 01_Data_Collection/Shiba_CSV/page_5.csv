I‚Äôve also done a lot of research to understand in order to make some significant gains I‚Äôm going to need to invest a hell of a lot more.   SHIB needs to burn off a lot of coins. I was doing the math which may not be a hundred percent accurate but they would need to burn off enough coins to set the market cap at 100 billion to even get the price to .001. 99.98% of the supply would need to be burned.   Burns are currently at around 10-50 million a day.. which is extremely slow. I read somewhere that they were planning to speed this up but can‚Äôt remember where.   There are various other factors too like utility and demand. It‚Äôs definitely possible in the coming years for it to take off, I‚Äôm hopeful but, I‚Äôm not at the edge of my seat. This is definitely a set and forget situation.  It‚Äôs not being pessimistic it‚Äôs being realistic. If you invested and want to leave then so be it, maybe they will start implementing a burn rate for transactions as well.

1hfegbe,YoOow28,"I am not necessarily hating on SHIB and still own a bit, but I am happy I pulled most of it out.   This coin is never gonna go anywhere and people need to understand that you're not gonna make much more money out of it anymore. The hypetrain passed a looooooooooong time ago.   Just look at the facts and you'll understand..   Don't get me wrong, this coin is still very interesting for people who like to high risk invest a fuck ton of money to 2x their investment. For people who invest like 50 bucks: you're not gonna make a lot of money with it.   To be completely honest, it's only interesting and actually profitable for big whales.   Simple fact:  - Bitcoin went up 78% in the last 90 days It surpassed it's all time high multiple times and crossed the 100k mark.   - Ethereum went up 73% in the last 90 days.  It's about to cross the 4k mark again.   Both Ethereum and Bitcoin should have rocket SHIB to or at least close to it's all time high.. instead it went up 105% which is not bad but unless you invested a good sum of money, it didn't made that much money. Most of shiba holders are 50-100$ investors hoping it to reach 0,01 somehow (impossible but that's another story).   Therefore you can say: this coin is not gonna X10, x20.. or whatever amount you've got in your head.   If it would it would've already made a big jump to that.   I even doubt if it's all time high will ever be reached again.

1hfegbe,YoOow28,"Proving you right about creating a chatgpt account? You do know how ChatGPT/AI works right??   The only thing ChatGPT is doing is to create a somewhat logical story about all the information that has been put out on the internet. It uses those resources to create a possible scenario to come to the conclusion of your question..   It doesn't mean it knows what the coin is about to do.   Simple math:   If we keep a price of let's say 0,000025 and say we're gonna times that by x150   So 0,000025 x 150 = 0,00375 (new price)  With the current supply this means we will have to x150 the current market cap too.   The marketcap at 0,000025 would be around 14 billion.   So 14 billion x 150 = 2,1 trillion dollar Marketcap.   Bitcoin has a marketcap of 2,1 trillion. That would mean it would be the same or surpass Bitcoin in marketcap value..   There is just no way that that's a possibility. There are no plans / indications for it to reach that.. if you wanted to make a million bucks with this coin you would've had to invest a couple bucks at the release of Shib. It's not gonna happen anymore. Unless you're willing to risk like 100-200k dollars. In that case it could be possible.",-1,1734438061.0,2024-12-17 12:21:01
1hfegbe,Icy-Maize-7281,Let‚Äôs say in 3 cycle from now so around 8years from now Bitcoin will surpass 500k-1millipn per coin which would increase the market cap in the the trillions it would appreciate all other cryptos when alt coin season arrives and make insane gains,3,1734447794.0,2024-12-17 15:03:14
1hfegbe,YoOow28,"Seriously bro, are you actually for real or just trolling because you just can't be this blind to logic and basic understanding of how crypto / coin volumes etc. work..  Sure Bitcoin will rise in price, SOME altcoins may follow.. but SHIB has too many coins in circulation to be one of those coins..   For the last time: for SHIB to gain that much in price: over 25% of the circulating supply (so the coins that YOU are holding) have to be burned (GONE, in the bin, with currently no rewards for doing so).   So a simple question: are you willing to throw away 25% of the coins that YOU are holding?   Keep in mind: you must trust the whole community to do the same otherwise it is just money lost and thrown away and it won't even move the coin by 0,000000000001.   That's what NEEDS to be done to get to the point what you expect the coin would do.   This is something that has been spoken about for years.. but it's just not realistic.   Most of the supply is in the hands of really big whales that bought at the release of the coin. They are the people who can change this but they won't because of the simple fact that they can make a stable flow of money without rugpulling the coin. They make millions off the backs of the small holders. It's really simple to see/understand why this coin is actually still a thing.. same for DOGE.

1hfegbe,YoOow28,"You must be delusional..   The only way for shib to 150x now is if 25% or more of the supply somehow vanishes.. SHIB had some traction in the past because it had this friendly feud with Doge community and it acted on Elons tweets about Doge and pretended it was meant for shib, also it was newly released and there were a lot of plans on the table.   It also helped when Vitalek Buterin burned all the coins that were given to him. That created a little stability.   But since that hype and since it's all time high SHIB has only gone down hill with a couple surges back to the current value. It has never gone close to it's all time high since, even now when crypto is booming and most cryptos are surpassing their ATH's SHIB is still not even close to it's ATH..   Most of the projects/plans have been released and have flopped. Barely anything is in the pipeline and the only reason this coin is still alive is because it's community and faulty misleading articles that somehow create this delusional idea that this coin is going to x100. There is no way it will unless coins are being burned by the trillions a day.. but there is no reward for it to be burned so there is no reason to do it. Only big whales can change the trajectory of this coin by burning their supply. Unless SHIB comes up with a reward there is no reason they will burn their investment and they will only manipulate the market to trick fools into buying a couple 100 or a couple 1000 bucks of Shib to just dumb their trillions again, rebuy at the dip to keep it alive and do the same trick over and over again.

1hdxurx,Burning-Gundam,"Hello there. Since many people are not giving you a straight answer, I'll try my best.   To answer your question. NO. You will not make significant or life changing money with your $10. You would need to invest thousands of dollars at a lower cost. Also, it is important to note that it is best to buy when the token is massively down in price in order to accumulate more and sell when it goes up.   What you need to understand is that SHIB has a massive amount of coins in circulation. There are about 589 TRILLION coins. Bitcoin is where it is because there are only 21 million coins. Also, Bitcoin has been accepted as a coin that has utility, for example, being used for payments. Also, the gas fees to use Bitcoin are a lot less than SHIB.  The only thing that could move the price up is the developers creating a system to burn SHIB tokens in massive amounts. At the current burn rate, it could take hundreds of years for SHIB to reach a penny. Possibly even thousands of years.   The more tokens people buy, the more tokens are burned, reducing the circulating supply. But it is not enough. People would need to buy SHIB in massive amounts in order to burn tokens faster. Again, the developers need to come up with a way to burn tokens faster.   Sorry to break it to you, but you will never see a penny. There's nothing wrong with holding some, but $10 is not going to help you. I had around 150 million tokens because I kept buying $10 every week for years. I sold everything because it was not going to get to a value worth enough for me to hold. I made 2k in profits, so I converted everything into XRP and HBAR.  Look into better projects like ETH, XRP, ADA, or HBAR. Even holding some COMP would not be a bad idea, considering there's only 8.8 million tokens in circulation. That's less than half of what Bitcoin has. Diversify in better tokens with a more promising outcome.   You can still get in better projects. But you can still hold on to your SHIB and add a little bit here and there to see where it goes. Hope this helped. Good luck. üëç",1,1734226639.0,2024-12-15 01:37:19

That is why it is impossible in this day.  The only ways for it to reach $1 would be decades of rapid inflation for global currencies resulting in the market cap for shib to reach $1 being worth less than 1% of global gdp, OR if 99.999% of all shib was removed from the market aka burned.
