Some people make a few bucks here and there by taking out at every rise and buying back in at every dip but that only gets you minimal gains‚Ä¶maybe 15-60 buckere here and there depending on how much money you‚Äôre investing. If you wanna see real gaines it would take alot of investment up front and steady investments weekly or monthly on the dips and waiting  over time for the long haul. Im talking about 1-3 years of holding and investing depending on the rate at wich it rises to see a substantial increase. You must be prepared to invest over 1,000 dollars, and you must also be aware and understand that you very well could lose all of it. Its lost a few zero‚Äôs since i started investing, and i will stand to make a few hundred thousand dollars if it loses 2 more zeros. The golden spot that everyone is hoping for is the .01 cent mark. For example bit coin started less then 1 cent in 2010 but now is over 100k per coin.
