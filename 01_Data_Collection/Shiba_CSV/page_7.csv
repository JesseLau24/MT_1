Short term, ofc you can see some gains, sometimes ungodly, congrats to those that do but I'm so tired of the meme token followed by thousands of clones being shilled and somehow people believe in them enough to not be failures, already has happened with pepe and many others. This token piggybacking off of DOGE was kinda the start and i was totally cool with at first cuz on another chain, may have some use case who knows. But everything spiraled out of control.  If we took all the time and money from all the clones and pumped into the actual memes we'd have meme themed lambo car meets.

1h9yrci,Killer_Stickman_89,"Both of your tokens are fucked. The only reason PEPE is ""doing well"" now is because it pretty much just launched. With over 420 Trillion in circulating supply it has essentially no real room for growth either. Unless you bought at launch you won't be making any substantial money off of it.  SHIB and PEPE have a combined amount of nearly 1 Quadrillion in circulating supply. It will never hit 1 cent, it will never hit a tenth of a cent, it will never hit a hundredth of a cent, etc. Theoretically at the current burn rate you'd have to wait around a decade to even have a chance. In which case you've also missed out on multiple bullruns and 10 years worth of entry points in other projects that have an actual future.  Somebody random could put in a ""whopping"" *$20* and essentially have a million of them. The circulating supply of your token is too massive. There are too many theoretically giant bag holders. Your chance to get rich off of SHIB ended almost half a decade ago.",1,1733796200.0,2024-12-10 02:03:20

You can also make quick buys and sell whenever, like day trading. In order to day trade stocks, using Robinhood, you would need $25,000 in the spending account. So stock picks you cannot resale for 24 hours, or you get a strike. 3 strikes equals no access to your account for a month, which I think a literal robbery.

1h8nh9z,NoxImus421,"While the concerns raised in this message are valid and highlight important risks associated with speculative investments like Shiba Inu (SHIB), there are other perspectives to consider:  1. Utility and Development: While the message claims Shiba Inu has no utility, the ecosystem is actively developing projects such as Shibarium, a Layer-2 blockchain solution, and ShibaSwap, its decentralized exchange. These developments aim to provide utility beyond being a ""meme coin."" Utility is essential for driving adoption and creating long-term value.   2. Burn Mechanisms: The Shiba Inu community has implemented token burn strategies, which reduce the circulating supply over time. As the supply decreases, the price potential increases without requiring an astronomical market cap. While significant burns are necessary, the community's commitment to this approach cannot be dismissed.   3. Market Dynamics: Cryptocurrency markets are highly speculative and can defy traditional financial logic. Assets like Dogecoin, which also started as a meme, have reached significant valuations despite lacking initial utility. Shiba Inu's strong community and branding give it momentum similar to Dogecoin's rise.   4. Investment Strategies: Dismissing SHIB outright ignores the potential for short- or medium-term profits due to market volatility. Many traders profit from small price movements rather than holding for unrealistic goals like $0.01. Educating investors about responsible investing is more effective than discouraging participation outright.   5. The Nature of Crypto: Cryptocurrencies, especially meme coins, are speculative by nature, and many investors participate with the understanding that they are taking a risk. It‚Äôs essential to invest only what you can afford to lose, but assuming every investor is unrealistic about the coin‚Äôs potential dismisses their ability to make informed decisions.   6. Future Possibilities: While a $0.01 valuation without significant burns is unlikely, it‚Äôs important to acknowledge that technological advancements, partnerships, or unforeseen market shifts could enhance Shiba Inu‚Äôs value proposition over time.   Responsible Investment Reminder:  While optimism is part of the crypto space, it‚Äôs crucial to emphasize risk management and realistic expectations. Investors should:  Research thoroughly.  Diversify their portfolio.  Avoid risking funds they can‚Äôt afford to lose.   The key takeaway is balance: acknowledge the risks while also considering the potential opportunities with an informed, cautious approach.",1,1733601998.0,2024-12-07 20:06:38

1h7ytqf,Deep-Manager-5306,How do I trade all my sol memecoins for shib if I wanted to go all in. Best way to do the simplest swap from sol to shiba inu on eth? Was recommended Mach Exchange for cross chain swaps - curious about your guy's thoughts.,1,1733508421.0,2024-12-06 18:07:01
1h7ytqf,BeginningInsect9699,I haven't practiced moving coin to different platforms in a while. I think i was successful moving coin from crypto dot com to coinbase. I don't remember. I just let it set and forget it now.  I used to play with wallets as well. I might have more. Just have to find where I wrote the address down lol Sorry I couldn't be more of a help.,2,1733508678.0,2024-12-06 18:11:18
1h7ytqf,Deep-Manager-5306,Ah but I believe those might have some fees since they are centralized exchanges. Yeah was looking for more decentralized solutions like uniswap but offers more cross-chain networks,2,1733508764.0,2024-12-06 18:12:44
1h7ytqf,BeginningInsect9699,Oh yeah I forgot about the gas fees. Don't remind me.,1,1733509079.0,2024-12-06 18:17:59
1h7ytqf,Deep-Manager-5306,"Mach exchange is pretty cool, seems like they are subsidizing eth gas costs! Been doing most my trades there",1,1733511248.0,2024-12-06 18:54:08

1h8d2vi,Quail-Street,"Do I trust it? Yes I trust it. But, I would really recommend almost anything else, because on Webull pay, you can‚Äôt do anything, you do not actually own the coin, they do, they are holding it for you. If you ever want to get rid of it, or swap for anything else, you have to sell for cash, and then buy whatever you want.   I was in a situation back when it was just Webull, that I had the liquid that I needed to buy a certain crypto, on Webull and they has just started offering crypto. Now I am stuck with it on Webull pay. The only way I can figure out to move it is via selling it for cash and then transferring to my bank and then transfer it my preferred wallet. Then I am stuck paying taxes on that $, just to reinvest it. I don‚Äôt plan to touch my crypto until I‚Äôm comfortably retired, so you can see why that is not a good deal for me.",3,1733555801.0,2024-12-07 07:16:41
