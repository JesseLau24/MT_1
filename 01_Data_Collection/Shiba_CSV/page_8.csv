1h6yry9,BeeBranze,"Look, it's not like I don't want you to be right, but math is unfortunately a thing and it just ain't mathin'. Just look into how market cap works and calculate it with the current circulating supply (almost 600 TRILLION coins). An insane, pretty much impossible amount of burn would have to happen, or many trillions of dollars would have to flow into the coin. Neither is likely to happen within a span of a few years.

1h6yry9,BeeBranze,"Sure, but the number of coins is not even close. Bitcoin has 19.5 million in circulation, is approxinately 0.000003% of the shib coins in circulation.

1h6yry9,BeeBranze,"No worries, you're good. Burning just means crypto is sent to an inaccessible or ""dead"" wallet address. This removes it permanently from circulation, which increases the value of each coin remaining in circulation. Very early on, about 500 trillion coins were sent to the creator of Ethereum. He, in turn, burned 410 trillion of them, which is 41% of the total supply of 1 quadrillion coins.",1,1733497332.0,2024-12-06 15:02:12
1h6yry9,Unique_Hat2995,Do the creator(s) of the coin have to justify of the burning ? Or they can burn whatever they feel like burning ? If they don’t have to justify the burning of the coin why not burn a huge amount to increase the value ?,2,1733499052.0,2024-12-06 15:30:52
1h6yry9,BeeBranze,"Nobody has to justify burning anything they want to. The disincentive is that burning those coins is akin to throwing their value into the abyss. So if some whale has a huge amount, say $1 billion worth, if they were to burn it they would no longer have that billion dollars. It would increase the value for everyone else holding the coin, but the person/people burning them would be losing out.",2,1733501059.0,2024-12-06 16:04:19

They don’t care much about interviews so I can just walk up there and walk back home knowing I’ll have a job secured without worrying about wasting energy.
