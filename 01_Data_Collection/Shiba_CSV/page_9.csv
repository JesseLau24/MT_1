1h4e6qq,ChampOfSon,"Well, Shibarium is mostly a failure, but there is a gas fee to do transactions on there, so a portion of those fees are gathered and used to buy and then burn Shib tokens.  There's a few community members that have done it.  A new token just burned 5.1B Shib tokens as a gimmick to advertise their project.  The only ever real and impact full burn was when Vitalik Buterin burned over 40% od the circulating supply from his half of the Shib token supply that was given to him as an unwanted gift as a symbolic burn in the beginning. That he actually ended up burning the vast majority of those tokens was pretty cool.  IF something like Shibarium were to have billions of dollars of volume a day, the burn mechanism attached to it would be more impactful. But I think it was a major fail for them to make a L2 called Shibarium but then require BONE tokens to be used as the gas. It could have been Shib tokens or even Ethereum but they chose the token they invented and controlled out of greed imo.  Note the Shib ""team"" is just community members that declared themselves as such. The Shiba Inu contract was designed and launched so that there could never be a true owner or team behind the Shib contract.  A selfless community would have built a L2 that used the Shib token itself making it more accessible to people to use. Or just Ethereum like BASE does in Coinbase's L2. Base has a lot of volume as a result and imagine if something like Shiabariim existed with a lot of volume and a burn mechanism attached to that volume.",1,1733262855.0,2024-12-03 21:54:15
1h41h5h,External-Ad-6098,Truth is who seriously cares what opinions people have . If you love the project or utility invest what you can.

1h41h5h,Affectionate_Seat959,"You know who the Shib whales are? Besides Big exchanges that want inventory to sell to their retail customers like you and I. Exchanges love this because they make a ton of money with people buying and selling in fees. Eth holders love it because those who transfer Shib to cold wallet pay eth for fees which burns eth supply. A Shib whale as an individual is not someone that took actual 21 million dollars and bought Shib. They took eth that they have had and bought at $1 or mined in early days and exchanged it for Shib. They don‚Äôt really care about Shib. They are buying Shib to burn eth supply to made their eth more valuable and go up. These gentlemen and ladies have millions and some even have billions in Eth value to exchange. Every time eth is exchanged on eth blockchain eth percentage is burned this includes any crypto that uses eth block chain like Shib, lessen the supply of Eth making it go up in value. Eth is stalled and not going up as fast as Bitcoin is. If Shib goes up then that is extra for them, For Shib, we need to burn a lot of the supply by using their block chain on their exchange. Anyone here doing that? Anyone here staking their Shib there? Also The problem is the people Shib Devs that control how much is burned; it is not automatic like eth block chain. Someone there has to push the key to burn Shib by sending it to the dead wallet.  Any volunteers that wanna burn their Shib? Anyway it will be a very long time before burns through two zeros. Maybe 2026 one zero or close to it like .00009 for a few months. I see Shib as that hot girl friend or boy friend that is big tease. All tokens that are on exchanges will do well this coming year. My advice is look at the chart history for Shib to know best time to buy. Right now and coming weeks are going to be interesting.

And the only real reason why everyone says this is bullshit is because they're astounded by it's success to catch on, and so it's pretty much just the wider financial world saying.... ""nuh uh.... it can't be legitimate.  It's all based on nothing.""  As if money itself is based on something other than faith...  That's like the pot calling the kettle black...  Bitcoin brought crypto, as a whole, legitimacy.  This boom here, after a crash that many thought could wipe crypto out, or at least knock it back to an obscure risky thing, is only happening because trust, faith, and legitimacy.  No sane person would turn down 10 bitcoin, just willingly given to them.  Why?  Because... it is universally accepted, just like money, that this would have extreme value.  Shiba, Doge, Pepe, etc.... they're the next ones up, to become real legitimate global currencies that have value, pretty much anywhere in the world, even if they're harder to transact at the moment...  Bitcoin is fortunate in that it literally has the nation of El Salvador using it as a national currency.  Any nation, even a city, or town, that transacts primarily in a particular crypto, breathes a ton of life into it.  What happens when Guatemala or Costa Rica adopt Doge or Shiba?  Their economies, just like El Salvador, as a whole, will become more prosperous, and the currency will spike in value, and mine and yours investment and faith in this will have helped bring that to them.  I've been to Afghanistan, and it sucks, but even the Taliban could adopt something like this, and both they and I, would prosper greatly financially speaking.  It would've been a funny topic to bring up when I had previously met with warlords 20 years ago...  I wonder if they would've shot at us less, if we helped make each other rich...

I thought SHIB would be in a better spot all these years but the community SOMEHOW didn't care or do anything about their tokens having a circulating supply of almost 600 Trillion FOR OVER 4 YEARS!  Trump owns a fuck load of ETH and he is going to be President of The United States.

If there is some serious price movement leading up to that moment the floor is going to raise exponentially. Meaning that your entry point and opportunity to 2x, 3x, 4x, etc. on coins and tokens with actual use cases and SIGNIFICANTLY less than **1** Trillion in circulating supply will GREATLY diminish.

1h3rm4o,Killer_Stickman_89,XRP has gotten legal clarity from the SEC and is essentially at ATH levels. While it will not be worth more than Bitcoin or ETH. If you actively chose to dump money into SHIB over it you are a fool. It still has a lot of potential growth in this bullrun alone that would greatly surpass your gains from holding SHIB. As your token has essentially no room for growth period. The circulating supply is too large. I'm saying this as someone who kind of has a grudge against the XRP Army as well.,0,1733162271.0,2024-12-02 17:57:51

1h3rm4o,Killer_Stickman_89,"I mean if you are only holding 4 digits and you cannot put significant money into other projects with your income. Then logically there's not really much of a reason to hold it in SHIB. Only reason it'd be acceptable is if you bought A LOT in say January of this year.   You don't know when this bullrun will end or what the floor will be after it's concluded. Odds are its gonna pump pretty hard towards the end of this month and in January of 2025. If it's stays stagnant after Trump's inauguration. Then it will dip, HARD, and that will be your only chance to buy back in.   The logical conclusion would be to buy into market while it's currently stagnant. The floor right now will already be much higher than it was during the last crash at worst because the price of BTC right now is 95k with I think a 98k ATH. So even in the event that BTC somehow stays at around 95-98k for 2-3 months straight despite being shilled by both Elon and Trump at this point, and despite the SEC no longer being a real obstacle for BTC and many other cryptocurrencies going forward. You'd still *initially* lose near the exact same amount that you have for holding it. **However in both the short and long term you'd make way more money.** Because with another token you'd have more options for that token to make whatever you lost back and then some with APY. There are so many wallets and even exchanges like Coinbase. That will give you good APY just for holding without having to stake. You do that and throw in investments during the dip and by the time the next bullrun happens you'd be absolutely stacked. It's a lot more preferable and logical than waiting I think what they are saying here is **10 years.** I have a feeling that unless you spent like 10-20k on it during ATH levels you could probably put back in whatever you sell in a week or less if holding SHIB matters that much to you.  Lol I'm just telling you how it is. My guess is that Elon couldn't give less of a shit about SHIB and the same could be said for Donald Trump. In fact I'd argue they'd drag SHIB in the mud to make DOGE look better. Which could tank the price.",0,1733162613.0,2024-12-02 18:03:33

It's honestly not a black/white question. Like, there's so many different strategies for market investments. It's hard to know when to buy or sell for regular stock markets, let alone crypto, which is much more volatile in that the markets fluctuate a lot, each currency isn't backed by any product (usually), and a lot of currencies are built off of memes, and tend to die fast or soar high, there's very little in between.  Shib has done well as a meme coin thus far, it's been one of those rare middle ground coins that hasn't died, this community is very passionate about the coin  But in general, I say there's no bad time to buy in. In general, buy the dip. I bought my first shib coins in 2021, at that time 1 dollar bought me nearly half a million coins. Now you need nearly 5 bucks to get that amount. I say if you dont feel good buying in right now, wait for the next big dip and buy in. Otherwise, why wait?

1h1bhmo,PsychologyOwn257,"Shiba Inu is currently trading at .00002554/token. There are currently 589.26 trillion tokens in circulation. Multiply the token supply by the price and you get $15 billion, which is the market cap of the coin. In other words the total value of all the coins combined.   Let‚Äôs say you were extremely bullish on Shiba Inu and you believe it will one day be just as valuable as bitcoin (currently 1.9 trillion market cap). Assuming the supply remains steady, a single Shiba coin would still only be worth $.003. You can do the math yourself. 589 trillion times .003 equals $1.77 trillion.
