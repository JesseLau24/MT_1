1iv5dph,irb26detti,They are the same. Look it up on yahoo finance and it shows read. Look it up on Coinbase it shows blue. I have it in trust wallet and its red but if i send it to Coinbase it turns blue,3,1740190758.0,2025-02-22 02:19:18

1iv5dph,Revolutionary_Pr1ce,I donâ€™t know the blue one only the red one but Iâ€™ve been out of crypto for a year or so,1,1740252179.0,2025-02-22 19:22:59
1iv5dph,Dapper_Landscape_909,ticker: SHIB,1,1740281619.0,2025-02-23 03:33:39
1iv5dph,Dapper_Landscape_909,I recommend going here and posing the same question r/shibARMY,1,1740281899.0,2025-02-23 03:38:19
1iv5dph,Feeling_Amoeba_1042,Neither they both garbage,1,1740318712.0,2025-02-23 13:51:52
1iv5dph,Cautious-Recording97,My shib is always in the red so whatâ€™s it matter,1,1740350791.0,2025-02-23 22:46:31
1iv5dph,WookOhSaurusRex,Either way youâ€™re getting scammed out of money.. Iâ€™d say pick the color you like better.,1,1740359630.0,2025-02-24 01:13:50
1iv5dph,valjirah,Thank youuu,2,1740182285.0,2025-02-21 23:58:05
1iv5dph,valjirah,Those are both screenshots from Coinbase.   There's two in Coinbase that use SHIB. The blue one is SHIBA INU and the red one is Shiba Inu.   I already checked the contract address from Coingecko and it took me to the blue one. So it looks like the blue one is the official one on Coinbase.,1,1740190948.0,2025-02-22 02:22:28
1iv5dph,valjirah,aaaaahhh,1,1740182167.0,2025-02-21 23:56:07
1iv5dph,valjirah,Thank u ðŸ˜Š,2,1740195692.0,2025-02-22 03:41:32
1iv5dph,valjirah,What would I do without you,2,1740281655.0,2025-02-23 03:34:15
1iv5dph,valjirah,I may just do that! But I checked the contract address from Coingecko (which had a red icon) and it took me to the blue SHIB on Coinbase. So im like 99% sure that the blue one is the real one :p,2,1740281990.0,2025-02-23 03:39:50

1iv5dph,valjirah,This is bad financial advice,2,1740359752.0,2025-02-24 01:15:52
1iv5dph,The_Grilled_Cheeze_1,Np. The red one is actually SHIBA instead of SHIB . Be careful to look at the ticker to confirm before buying,8,1740182411.0,2025-02-22 00:00:11
1iv5dph,irb26detti,Ah. Been holding mine for years so didnt even know there were imposters,5,1740192029.0,2025-02-22 02:40:29
1iv5dph,Dapper_Landscape_909,"And if you go to CoinMarketCap, the image is red, for the real SHIB with 9 B market cap",1,1740281698.0,2025-02-23 03:34:58
1iv5dph,Dapper_Landscape_909,How can they have two with the same ticker?,1,1740281758.0,2025-02-23 03:35:58
1iv5dph,Dapper_Landscape_909,"I use Robinhood and they donâ€™t have an image, only the SHIB ticker. And Robinhood is pretty conservative about what coins they list.",3,1740282046.0,2025-02-23 03:40:46
1iv5dph,valjirah,No there are two SHIBS on Coinbase. There's also another one called SHIBA but that one has fiery eyes,3,1740182616.0,2025-02-22 00:03:36
1iv5dph,valjirah,Yes but this is Coinbase where the image is blue ðŸ”µ :/,1,1740281735.0,2025-02-23 03:35:35
1iv5dph,valjirah,"Lots of currency exchanges have that! Duplicates everywhere! One is Shiba Inu lowercase, the fake, and one is SHIBA INU, the real one in blue. I agree though there should be only one that can have a certain ticker but I guess if that was the case people would just grab tickers all the time and hold them to sell them or idk.",2,1740281869.0,2025-02-23 03:37:49
1iv5dph,Dapper_Landscape_909,Thatâ€™s strange manâ€¦,1,1740281871.0,2025-02-23 03:37:51
1iv5dph,CryptoMoneyLand,Just crazy. Now we have to check the contract now.,1,1740282780.0,2025-02-23 03:53:00
1iv5dph,valjirah,I know I wish it was standardized,2,1740281894.0,2025-02-23 03:38:14
1iv5dph,valjirah,Yup... and what's worse is people will just say something like XCN is on the move! And post a screenshot of it going up.   But they don't provide the CA so I go to my tracker and look up XCN and there's like more than 5 different XCNs! I clicked the one that most accurately matches the capitalization used in their post but it looks nothing like what they've got going on.   Gotta provide the CA for sure!,2,1740283206.0,2025-02-23 04:00:06
