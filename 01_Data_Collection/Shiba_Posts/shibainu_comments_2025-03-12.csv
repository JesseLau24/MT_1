1j9le8o,nerdburg,"I mean, if we knew that information we would all be rich.   You should learn the principles of HODL and DCA.   Right now is a time of uncertainty due to the US economy being on the brink of recession. If the US economy takes a shit, it's likely that crypto will take a shit too.   Personally, I've liquidated almost all of my investments, my $$ is sitting in high yield savings accounts right now. I'm only holding a few thousand $ in crypto. I think the current economic situation is only going to get worse and being in the markets right now is risky business.   I plan on sitting on my cash until the market crashes, then I'll buy back in.   Good luck whatever you decide!",2,1741795303.0,2025-03-12 16:01:43
