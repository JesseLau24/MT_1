1jiabeb,cinesias,"If there are 10,000,000 Shib holders, if everyone burns every single shib they have minus one shib, itâ€™ll be worth  $760 per Shib!!!  Which means every Shib holder will have $760 worth of shib!!  So, you burn all your Shib minus 1 Shib first, sound like a good plan to you?",3,1742769497.0,2025-03-23 22:38:17
1jiabeb,Shurikekat,"I understand that burning a huge quantity of coins increases the value of Shiba inu. It actually sounds ideal however not feasible. I think the most realistic way of increasing its value is adoption. If merchants or businesses will start using its coin as payment, its demand increases and it will eventually decrease the volume of Shiba inu coins. As more people use this coin for transactions, its value can rise due to greater demand. The UAE's Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure has partnered with Shiba Inu so let's wait and see.",1,1742793739.0,2025-03-24 05:22:19
1jiabeb,Living_Sky_2755,I see so many twitter accounts burning Shiba but why does the circulating supply never changes in Robinhood?,1,1742832081.0,2025-03-24 16:01:21
1jiabeb,Ok_View8272,"If someone spent and bought $1,000,000 worth of Shiba inu cryptocurrency it would go to d dollar and they would make a trillion dollars profit",0,1742771134.0,2025-03-23 23:05:34
1jiabeb,Ok_View8272,"If someone bought $1,000,000 USD worth of Shiba inu the price would skyrocket and the buyer would become the world's richest person will hundreds of trillions of Shiba inu valued at $1,000 USD individually whitch would make them the worlds first quadrillionare it might sound farfetched but do the math and you will see the numbers add up. So why hasn't anyone done this? It's because no one has done the official math until now and I don't have $1,000,000 to invest or 10 friends with $100,000 or 100 people with $10,000 dollars and even at that all investors would still profit trillions of dollars individually even 1,000 people at $1, 000 or 10,000 investors at $100 with each individual investors profiting millions of USD LETS SEE WHO WILL BE THE FIRST. This is the first opportunity for a whole family or community to join the ranks of millionaires and billionaires. Trust the process and invest in yours and your families future.",0,1742772920.0,2025-03-23 23:35:20
1jiabeb,ComprehensiveView304,Well i gotta ask do you invest in shiba? if so what do you see in it?,1,1742769724.0,2025-03-23 22:42:04
1jiabeb,Ok_View8272,"If someone bought $1,000,000 worth of Shiba Inu cryptocurrency the supply would drop so low they would profit 100+ Trillion dollars if I had $1,000,000 I'd spend it on Shiba inu cryptocurrency and literally I would become a multi trillionare overnight. Don't still my ideas.",0,1742771429.0,2025-03-23 23:10:29
1jiabeb,ComprehensiveView304,"wow i dident even know the UAE partnered up with them, when did it happen? also do you really think that shiba will be adapted? i mean currently its less then a penny why would people settle in for shiba instead of ethurem or bitcoin?",1,1742819014.0,2025-03-24 12:23:34
1jiabeb,newbneedsmoney,Because burning millions doesn't make a dent in the number. 589.3 trillion is an insane number to fathom. Burning 1 billion coins a day would still take over 1000 years.... let that sink in.,1,1743007377.0,2025-03-26 16:42:57
1jiabeb,ComprehensiveView304,you know shiba market cap right now is 7.8 billion right? i dont think one more million will pump the coin to 1 dollar. and yes i have done some math right now we have a supply of 590 trillion Shiba because 410 trillion have been burned someone will need to buy 500 trillion Shiba and burn it. then we will have 90 trillion left which still would not be valued at a dollar according to my calculation's,1,1742773201.0,2025-03-23 23:40:01
1jiabeb,cinesias,Imaginary math means youâ€™re going to be a millionaire soon. Sounds legit.,4,1742776312.0,2025-03-24 00:31:52
1jiabeb,ComprehensiveView304,"ok lets say someone bought 1,00,000 worth of Shiba and the price did go up to a dollar wouldn't they sell immediately and dump Shiba again?",1,1742772703.0,2025-03-23 23:31:43
1jiabeb,Shurikekat,I wish I knew the answer but hopefully this joint venture will  give us profit.,1,1742819302.0,2025-03-24 12:28:22
1jiabeb,ComprehensiveView304,so making shiba 1 dollar is gonna be really hard and take a long time,1,1742773240.0,2025-03-23 23:40:40
1jiabeb,ComprehensiveView304,also if its that simple why hasn't any of the billionaires done it yet?,1,1742772740.0,2025-03-23 23:32:20

1jiabeb,takacube,"That's roughly $6.5 Billion that someone would have to have laying around to scoop up 500 Trillion to burn.  Someone, through the charity in their heart, will throw away $6.5 Billion....that would still leave 89 TRILLION coins outstanding.",1,1742794569.0,2025-03-24 05:36:09
1jiabeb,ComprehensiveView304,lets say someone did that how much do you think those 89 trillion coins will be worth?,1,1742822626.0,2025-03-24 13:23:46
