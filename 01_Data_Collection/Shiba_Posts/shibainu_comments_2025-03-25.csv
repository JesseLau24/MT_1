1jjkc7y,Warminsandiego,"These posts are just ridiculous. If it actually went to the moon only one percent of the time that these posts predicted it would, I’d be shocked. Instead, it continues to go downward and the trend will lead to zero.",2,1742914112.0,2025-03-25 14:48:32

1jjkc7y,wavemeister1976,"The main pot holder is the creator of the coin, they hold an  estimated 70% of what remains in circulation. While us puppets are holding and buying dips burning coins, they just do nothing. I've held on for 3 years and bought dips, yet if I'd sold and put it elsewhere, I'd be on a small fortune. I generally think the steam has run out, and it's continually going downwards. People are investing in other coins",1,1743228714.0,2025-03-29 06:11:54

1jjfsid,Ok-Dirt1972,"Ya’ll took my question completely the wrong way, i wasnt asking as if i was waiting for the big get rich payday, i have most of my money in Utility coins and Bitcoin, i have a few hundred bucks in Shib im more than happy to just leave sit, i was asking because the Devs touted the burn mechanism as a selling point, i didnt say anything about anyone else burning their own supply either, some of ya’ll are so jaded you take every thing with a negative connotation",3,1742912401.0,2025-03-25 14:20:01
1jjfsid,Diligent_Cover3368,You should burn all of yours and show them how it’s done!!! Then maybe every one will burn theirs and then there would be only 1 and it would be worth a million trillion dollars!!! And it would be mine!! Isn’t that how it’s supposed to work? You throw your trash away and then my trash becomes valuable? If it’s shitty enough to burn it’s too shitty to hold.,1,1742897287.0,2025-03-25 10:08:07
1jjfsid,newbneedsmoney,People can't fathom how big a number 589.3 trillion really is. If you were to burn 1 billion coins every single day it would still take over 1000 years to get the supply down to a valuable number.,1,1742999032.0,2025-03-26 14:23:52
1jjfsid,Vivid-Ad9340,"In theory, burning supply increases value, but we're talking about the equivalent of scooping a bucket of sand at the beach every day and saying the value of sand is going to go up and sand is disappearing. It's not the most honest statement, but people use it to stir up a pump.",1,1743000300.0,2025-03-26 14:45:00

1jjfsid,Polyfluorite,"But they’re right though.   It might not be what you want to read but they’re right.   The devs were talking about burning a lot of the supply but they’re obviously not ready yet. I’m sure it will happen. But it might not happen for a while. Maybe for another 3 years.   If you want coins burned right now, then lead by example.  The other option is to wait. Which is what we’ve been doing.",3,1742901662.0,2025-03-25 11:21:02
