1jlhasv,itdoesntmatta69,"That little amount , (60 mil) burned consistently,  say twice a month for 10 years is a trillion.  So at least they're making an effort to do something .   If they're able to get more people commited it can make a difference. Especially when those who are in the red begin to get they're money back and contribute   Im fortunate enough to have bought my 400mil years ago I'm still in the positive,  but not by much. I bought a bunch of different meme coins specifically as a gamble that one day , at least one of them will pay off.   I'm ok with waiting 10 years.",2,1743317728.0,2025-03-30 06:55:28
1jlhasv,trobits,Agreed. We could be burning trillions if you join. We need the traffic. As simple as that!,-6,1743204045.0,2025-03-28 23:20:45

1jlhasv,trobits,"You are right that we want the Ad revenue. However, you did not mention that we use the Ad revenue to burn SHIB and LUNC. Check out the burn archive ([Trobits](https://trobits.com/archive/shiba)) and verify the burns for yourself!",0,1743252882.0,2025-03-29 12:54:42

1jlhasv,GodsmackedU2,One trillion wonâ€™t do anything look at Pepe with only 420 trillion they burned 1.7t and the price actually went down so I wouldnâ€™t hold ur breath on that one,1,1743479967.0,2025-04-01 03:59:27
1jlhasv,SnooStrawberries8174,Or get behind a coin that doesnâ€™t have an endless supply? Nothing against Shiba as Iâ€™ve owned and have made money off of it but yeahâ€¦And yes I know itâ€™s not endless but 1 quadrillion coins made? Thank God Vitalik Buterin burned all that was given to him orâ€¦this coin would be sitting at 0.0000000000000000004743864 ðŸ¤·,2,1743212647.0,2025-03-29 01:44:07

1jlhasv,wavaif4824,what percentage of the revenue do you use to burn Shib / Lunc?,2,1743270235.0,2025-03-29 17:43:55
1jlhasv,itdoesntmatta69,That number is just for the OP burn effort if it never grows and no more people join the movement.  There are other burn efforts currently and  there will be in the future. You're one of the people that expect one day 20 quadrillion tokens will be burned in a single burn. It doesn't work that way. It also isn't going to make you rich any time soon. That doesn't mean it never will. But you'll have sold at a lose long before then and will be in to the next one that you'll be under water in,1,1743507127.0,2025-04-01 11:32:07
1jlhasv,trobits,We don't want you to burn your coins. KEEP YOUR COINS! Sell them for a profit.  What we need is traffic to [www.trobits.com](http://www.trobits.com) We use Ad revenue to buy the coins and burn. Don't burn your coins,1,1743340948.0,2025-03-30 13:22:28
1jlhasv,trobits,"We use everything to burn the coins. We actually have to supplement it daily. Not including the cost of articles and marketing. We hope that soon, once we have enough traffic, the site will be able to take care of itself and we won't have to put in any more money. The beginning is always tough and someone has to pay the price!  We are doing this because we believe that SHIB and LUNC can get to $1 each. If that happens, we will be multimillionaires.  Likewise, many in the forum.   Remember, we need about 1000 views to make roughly $1. With enough traffic, we could be making thousands of dollars and burning billions of coins everyday!",2,1743341876.0,2025-03-30 13:37:56
