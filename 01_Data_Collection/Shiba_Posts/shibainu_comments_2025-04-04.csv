1jr3kv9,Vipin-1001,I will tell u the real future- When the whole market starts pumping SHIB will also pump.  So now you can do only 3 things.  1- Either you average down your purchase price by DCA strategy if any kind of major crash happens.  2- Just HODL if you have capacity to HODL for atleast 1-3 years  3- Sell and go away if you need money urgently,11,1743744140.0,2025-04-04 05:22:20
1jr3kv9,SuddenRabbit3126,"It's funny how people sell at the worst time. When things are down, people panick and sell, only to regret it later when things get better. Like Warren Buffet  says ""Buy when others are fearful and sell when others are greedy"". I'm adding to my position.",7,1743788525.0,2025-04-04 17:42:05

1jr3kv9,dontttttknow,What people don't understand is that the coin needs to burn. Holding that much is just holding savings. it is the community's responsibility to reduce the amount of coins in circulation. This coin will never jump again. I currently have 2 lost wallets. One with 11 trillion coins and one with 7 trillion coins. I bought the 11 trillion for $75 etheirum on coin cloud digital ATM. I jumped on this coin the soonest I could. Unfortunately I didn't think about my wallet when I whipped the phone.,3,1743918461.0,2025-04-06 05:47:41
1jr3kv9,morikami,No idea. I bought some for my dog because the idea of her holding dog-themed crypto is funny to me. Poor girl. I don't have the heart to tell her that the market is ruff right now.,5,1743822227.0,2025-04-05 03:03:47

1jr3kv9,nickrock007,"Buy utility coins not meme coins, meme coins are like going to vegas and gambling except you might have more fun in Vegas losing your money. There's tons of better coins to get into. Cut your losses and re invest. The only way to make money on meme coins is to get in super early and get out before the dump. You can still get your money back if you invest smart. I don't want to say what coins because I'll probably get booted for ""promoting"" something. The bull run is still a few months away. Play it smart and you can use your loss in shib to offset your capital gains taxes on your better investment. I was in your position myself and did what I'm telling you. I made millions and paid very little taxes from my huge losses on meme coins. But that just my opinion",1,1743993349.0,2025-04-07 02:35:49

1jr3kv9,NateMigs,"SHIB is nothing more than a pump and dump crypto with a leader who doesn't even use his real name. I'm sorry that you fell for the hype and scam that is SHIB. That being said, during the next pump, that's your signal to dump. So just watch out for the next big hype ""project"" and pull the trigger. That could be a few years from now though.",-4,1743790606.0,2025-04-04 18:16:46
